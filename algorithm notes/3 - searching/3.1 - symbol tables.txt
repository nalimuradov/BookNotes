3.1 - Symbol Tables

basic idea:
 - to associate a value with a key
 - client can insert key-value pairs
 - client can later search for the value associated with the given key
 - dictionary is an example of a symbol table

API:
 - put(Key key, Value val)
 - delete(Key key)
 - contains(Key key)
 - isEmpty()
 - size()
 - keys() [iterable]

design choices:
 - use generics for keys and values
 - no duplicate keys
 - no key can be associated with the value 'null'

ordered symbol tables:
 - makes put() and get() operations much more efficient
 - allows for a significantly expanded API
	- deleteMin(), deleteMax()
	- min(), max()
	- floor(), ceiling()

 - rank(): find the number of keys less than a given key
 - select(): find the key with a given rank

practice program:
 - can create a symbol table mapping letter grades to numerical GPA
	- eg. A+ -> 4.33, A -> 4.00, etc.
