INTRODUCTION -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

crime in the 90s:
 - all time high, and were projected to be even higher in the future by experts
 - however when it came around, it dropped hard in the 21st century
	- experts began saying that it was gun control or policing strategies that caused this
 - what caused it was norma mccorvey, who won the lawsuit that legalized abortion
	- children are not born equal, and those in poor households have a much higher chance of turning to crime
 	- when these kids weren't being born, the crime rates that were projected never happened

incentives:
 - it's nice to think that experts in a field will do what's best when paid or incentivized
	- you'd like to believe that a real estate agent will do their best to sell your house for top dollar
	- car mechanics will be lenient with fines, as they know there is a higher chance of a returning customer
 - sometimes, this isn't the case:
	- doctors will tend to perform c-sections in growing neighborhoods to ring up a higher bill

 - going back to the real estate example, we can compare how she sells her home vs our home to see if she is being fair
	- seeing as she wants to sell her own home for top dollar and ours as well, it may seem that our goals are aligned
	- however, selling the house for $1000 more will earn you an extra $900 while giving her an extra $90
		- there is not nearly as much benefit to her as there is to you
	- when she's selling her own house, she waits for the best offer
		- when she's selling your house, she encourages you to take the first decent offer

correlation vs causation:
 - just because two things are correlated, doesn't mean one causes the other
 - eg. money wins elections
	- it's true that who spends the most money often wins, but it doesn't mean one causes the other to happen
	- X might cause Y, Y might cause X, but it's also possible that Z might cause both X and Y
 - eg. cities with more police tend to have more murders
	- then you could say that the police cause murders, which makes no sense
	- these facts are correlated, and have no direct relationship with each other

 - there are two scenarios you would donate money in a political campaign typically:
	- if you had $1000k, you would give it if it was close and would make a difference in the decision
	- or give it to the sure fire winner to bask in the glory and get possible rewards when they win
	- what if one candidate was more appealing than the other:
		- and this earned them the votes AND money
		- how would we even measure appeal?

 - to test if money matters, we would need the same candidates running against each other multiple times over and over
	- with varying amounts of money
	- good for us, this has happened in nearly 1000 US congressional races
	- and it turns out, money hardly matters at all
		- a winning candidate can cut his money in half and lose only 1% of the vote
		- a losing candidate who doubles his money can expect to gain 1% of the vote

	- people say that $1 billion being spent on elections every year is so much
		- however it's important to compare things of similar scale
		- for example, the US also spends $1 billion on bubble gum every year

fundamental ideas of the book:
 - incentives are the cornerstone of modern life
 - convential wisdom is often wrong
 - dramatic effects often have distant and subtle causes (eg. norma mccorvey)
 - experts use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda
 - knowing what to measure and how to measure it makes the world much less complicated

1 - SCHOOLTEACHERS AND SUMOWRESTLERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

late daycare pickup:
 - sometimes at a daycare, parents would pick up kids late which would be annoying for the workers
 - economists decided to enact a fine where late pickups would add a charge to the parent
 - as it turns out, the number of late pickups increased substantially with the addition of the fine (opposite of desired effect)
 - economics is simply a study of incentives
	- if you put your hand on the stove, you get burnt
	- if you come home with straight A's, you get a new bike
 	- if you get caught picking your nose, you get ridiculed
	- if you make the basketball team, you go up in the social ladder at school
	- an incentive is simply a means of urging people to do more of a good thing and less of a bad thing
		- however they don't come about organically, we often have to invent them
		- eg. eat all your vegetables, and you get to go to the toy store

incentive types:
 - economic, social, and moral
 - eg. smoking:
	- $3 sin tax creates an economic incentive to not smoke
	- banning of smoking in restaurants creates a social incentive to not smoke
	- when US government says terrorists raise money by selling cigarettes through black market, it creates a moral incentive
 - back to the daycare example:
	- what the fine did was substitute the moral incentive with the economic incentive
		- picking up your child late often brings guilty feelings
		- now they don't feel guilty, as they can just trade their guilt for $3 every day
	- when the fine was removed, now they both didn't have to pay a fine nor feel guilty

 - another example of a moral vs economic incentive:
	- economists wanted to learn about the motivation behind blood donations
	- they found that by giving a small monetary reward for donating blood actually caused fewer people to donate
		- another example of turning a moral incentive into an economic one
	- now they are no longer doing a noble cause, but simply going through a lot of pain to make a few dollars
	- what if we made the monetary incentive very large ($1000):
		- every incentive has its dark side
		- people would begin to steal blood at knife point, or pass of pigs blood as their own
		- a thing worth having is a thing worth cheating for

cheating:
 - anyone will cheat if the stakes are right
	- whether it be a major exam or some small board game with friends
 - for every person who tries to come up with an incentive scheme, there will be another person who will try to cheat it
	- cheating is a primordial act: getting more for less

 - teachers have incentives to cheat too, if their pay/job security is affected by how well their students do
	- they can easily change some marks before submitting without anyone finding out
	- there would be ways to find the cheaters (comparing previous test scores, etc)

sumo wrestling:
 - sumo wrestling consists of 15 rounds, where 8 wins is needed for cutoff
 - how can we prove cheating in sumo wrestling
 - look at games between 8-6 and 7-7 score wrestlers
 	- the 7-7 has so much to gain and the 8-6 has little to lose
 - we expect the 7-7 to win 48% of the time based on their score and their skill
	- however if check data, 7-7 will beat 8-6 nearly 80% of the time
 - what's interesting is their next rematch, the loser of the previous one has an 80% win rate
	- "you let me win this time, i'll let you win next time"
	- after the 2 matches, they return to 50% winrate each
 - when there is scrutiny for rigging, the 7-7 and 8-6 winrates go back to 50%
 - even in the holy sport of sumo wrestling, people cheat

beer on the beach:
 - richard thaler found that a sunbather would pay $2.56 for a beer delivered from the resort hotel
 	- but only $1.50 if it came from a shabby grocery store

feldman bagel experiment:
 - white collar crime is difficult to evaluate, as there is little data
 	- as opposed to murders and robberies which have a victim and info
 - feldman's bagel business provided great insight and data into white collar crimes and cheating
 - smaller companies tended to pay more often
 - the weather also had some effect on how many people paid
 - more people paid after 9/11, likely due to a surge in empathy
 - certain holidays are good while others are bad for cheating, why?
	- thanksgiving and valentines day typically see more people not paying and stealing bagels
	- on the other hand, 4th of july and labor day have more people paying
	- likely because first holidays have other distractions and things to do, while 4th of july is simply a relaxed day off
 - however, we can't ignore that a large majority did pay, and we can't overfocus on the fraction that didn't
	- goodness is inherent, we want to make others feel good

2 - KU KLUX KLAN AND REAL ESTATE AGENTS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ku klux klan:
 - originally started as a club for lawyer friends like a frat
 - eventually became a white supremacy cult
 - known for lynchings, however lynchings went down dramatically over the years
	- notable to know that most lynchings occured when they were dormant (in the 1910s)
 - the great number of lynchings early on provided strong incentive for minorities to unfortunately be 2nd class citizens
 	- nobody wanted to get punished by death, by an organization in cahoots with law enforcement
 - there are few incentives more powerful than fear of random violence
	- which is why terrorism is so effective

 - in reality, the KKK was just a fraternity for poorly educated men to vent out at

 - stetson kennedy was a man who wanted to take down the clan and its influence on the government and the people
	- however, such a feat is like tossing a pebble at a giant
		- there are too many groups across the country that would take too long
 	- instead, his plan was to make public the klan secrets (eg. passwords, etc)
	- he infiltrated and got the information, then went to a big radio network listened by millions
		- unveiled Mr AYAK and Mr AKAI, roles of the clan (grand dragon), and many other things
	- eventually, tv shows like superman stopped portratying hitler/mussolini as the bad guy and replaced with KKK
		- before long, KKK rally attendance began to fall drastically
	- stetson crippled the klan by turning their private information into a ammo for mockery
 	- stetson understood the raw power of information
		- KKK was in power because it hoarded information, and stetson took that power from them
		- once that info falls into the wrong hands, any advantages you had disappear

life insurance and the internet:
 - in the late 1990s, price of term life insurance dropped dramatically
	- however other forms of insurance (health, car) were not dropping
 - what happened? the internet happened
 - a website called quotesmith.com was the first of several websites that allowed you to compare dozens of life insurance prices
	- best price made it much more competitive, allowing customers to shop for their preference
 - the website didn't even sell anything, it just listed the prices
	- they weren't selling insurance, but they were selling information
 - once that information was taken away from the insurance companies, they lost the power (and the money)

 - information asymmetries (one party knows something that other doesn't) has died down dramatically since the internet
 	- information is the currency of the internet
	- it is very good at shifting information from those who have it to those who don't
		- eg. term life insurance example, the information was scattered before, hidden away from people

 - car dealers and funeral directors used to be able to finesse your lack of knowledge
 	- funeral directors knew you were in emotional distress and offered $8000 for a casket (knowing you know nothing)
	- car dealers would tack on additional prices to your car
	- with the internet, they lose this power of information that they had

 - the internet has done a good job of minimizing information asymmetry, however asymmetry still exists
	- eg. early 2000 corporate scandals involving Enron
	- eg. sam waksal dumped all his ImClone stock when he got early word of a damaging report by the FDA
	- all these crimes are sins of information
		- they involve an expert promoting false information or hiding true information
	- experts depend on the fact that you don't have the information they do
		- if your doctor tells you that you should have an angioplasty (which does little to stop heart attacks)
			- you'll probably listen, and not consider that he may be using the information to score a few extra thousand dollars
			- a doctor can have the same economic incentives as a car salesman or a funeral director
	- armed with information, experts can leverage FEAR
		- fear that your children will find you dead from a heart attack
		- fear that the $25000 car will explode in a crash but the $50000 will keep your family safe
		- fear like the fear used by the ku klux klan

selling your house:
 - when selling a house, you may have two fears: not selling it all (price too high), or selling it too cheap (price too low)
 - it is up to your real estate agent to use her information to find the perfect price
	- you feel fortunate that you have an expert helping you, however she sees things differently
 - a real estate agent may not see you as an ally, but as a mark
	- back to our intro example, real estate agents keep their own house listed for 10 more days and sell for 3% higher than yours
		- this is an extra $10000 on a $300000 house
 - with your house, she gets a smaller cut so taking an extra $10000 will net her only like $150
	- rather than waiting for the best offer, she will try to sell it ASAP
 - her tasks isn't to find a buyer for $310000, her task is to convince you that $300000 is a good offer
	- rather than call you a fool, she will bring up the nicer house down the street which hasn't sold for 6 months
	- she will convert information into fear

 - example with K the buyer:
	- wanted to buy a house listed $469 000, but was prepared to offer $450 000
	- he called the agent of the seller, and asked what their lowest price was
	- the agent "scolded" K who said that is a violation, but mentioned that they are willing to sell for much lower
	- K then made an initial offer of $425 000, which was accepted at $430 000 
	- the seller's agent was able to sell the house really fast while only losing $300 for themselves
		- the family lost at least $20 000 as they sold for much lower
		- seller got her commission and was able to dip to the next mission

 - real estate lingo:
 	- like the klan members, there are key passwords that agents use to sell houses at lower prices
	- good words:
		- granite, state of the art, corian, maple, gourmet
		- these are physical properties about the house that are good
	- bad words:
		- fantastic, spacious, charming, good neighborhood
		- these are filler words that have no meaning and are put there due to lack of good qualities

 - does this make real estate agents bad people:
	- they are not bad people, they simple ARE people
	- and people respond to incentives
	- think of how you describe yourself in a job interview, or a first date
		- do you tell them you are a gambler and addict?

exaggerating and dating sites study:
 - two economists and a psychologist studied dating sites to see what people wrote about themselves in their bio
 	- 4% of men said they earn $200 000+, whereas in reality only 1% of people on the internet earn that much
	- 72% of women said they have above average looks, which is a fallacy
		- like a real estate agent, no one will look at a house if it doesn't say "charming", even if it's not
 	- some were honest, like the 243 married men on the dating site
		- however only 12 of them posted a picture, indicating that the fear of getting caught outweighed the reward
 - of the many ways to fail on a dating website, not posting a photo is the most certain
	- man who does not post photo gets 60% responses, women get 24% responses (if 100% was with a photo)
	- there can be many reasons to not post a photo (technically challenbed, doesn't look good)
		- however to others, they will assume there is something seriously wrong under the hood, like a car without a pic

 - men who say they want a long-term relationship do better, while women who say they want a quick fling do great
	- for men, a woman's looks is of paramount importance
	- for women, a man's income is most important

 - this is very similar to dataclysm, by christian rudder
	- lots can be found out about humans by looking at the data
	- eg. on the dating site, you have two options: "same race as mine" or "race doesn't matter" preferences
		- 80% of men said they didn't care, however 90% of their messages went to white women
		- 50% of women said they didn't care, yet 97% of their messages went to white men
	- do they say race doesn't matter because they want to appear open-minded?
	- there is a massive gulf between the information we proclaim versus the truth

lying and voting:
 - everyone agrees that politicians lie, but voters lie too
 - if a voter in a line is asked if they're voting for the black or white candidate, they will often say black candidate
	- to appease the crowd and look woke
 - dinkins (black politician) and giuliani (white politican) ran against each other in NY 1989
	- pre election polls showed dinkins winnig by a landslide, but he only won barely by 15 points
	- could it be that people don't want to admit their preference when it doesn't look as good

3 - WHY DRUG DEALERS STILL LIVE WITH THEIR MOMS -------------------------------------------------------------------

convential wisdom:
 - definition (not a compliment) by galbraith
 - we associate truth with convenience, with what most closely accords with our self-interest and to avoid effot and dislocation in life
 - we also find highly acceptable what contriubutes most to self-esteem
 - it's not that convential wisdom is never true, but we must notice where it may be false

homeless deaths:
 - homeless advocate mitch snyder said that about 3 million homeless americans die each year
 - the public took notice, as that is 1/100 americans, which is surprisingly a lot
 - the problem was suddenly catapulted into national consciousness
 - snyder also testified that 45 homeless people die each second, which would mean 1.4 billion a year
	- population of US at the time was 225 million
 - turns out he made up a number for the presses that were hounding him
 - however, it still got people aware of the situation and moving

listerine and advertising:
 - was initially used as a surgical antiseptic, then floor cleaner, then a cure for gonorrhea
 - in the 1920s it was sold as a cure for halitosis (bad breath)
	- bad breath was never an issue for people, but the listerine ads made it a problem that needed to be fixed
	- they ran ads that showed young men/women with bad breath getting their partners turned off
 - listerine made $8 million and turned bad breath from nothing to a catastrophe
	- "listerine didn't make mouthwash, it made halitosis"

exaggerations and convential wisdom:
 - like homelessness, one side wins the war of convential wisdom
 - feminism advocates mention that 1/3 women will be a victim of rape or attempted rape
	- in reality, the stats are more like 1/8, but no one wants to oppose it because it is a good message
 - advocates for cures of various diseases often do the same to draw attention to the problem

crack in the 90s:
 - police across cities in america scrambled for resources to try and deal with cocaine epidemic
 - the media made it known however that crack dealers had state  of the are weapons with endless cash
	- this worked immensely, as nothing infuriates a law-abiding populace more than a millionaire crack dealer
 - as such, the media tried its best to portray crack dealing as the most profitable job in america
 - however, if you spend time where crack was sold, this wasn't the case
	- not only did most dealers live in the projects, but they still lived at home with mom, why is that?

 - sudhir venkatesh story (finding black disciples gang in abandoned building)
 - the reality is, they don't make that much money
	- like a pyramid scheme, unless you are at the top, you are making pennies
	- most dealers are working under others and get skimmed on profits
	- they had no choice but to live at home
	- a crack gang works just like a standard capitalist enterprise, similar to mcdonalds
 	- foot soldiers also risked arrests as they had to stand at the corner all day
		- they are like the mcdonalds burger flipper or walmart stocker of their group
	- foot soldiers had a 1/4 chance of being killed
		- compare that to 1/200 for timber cutters, which is said to be the most dangerous job in america
		- or death row in texas prison, which has executed only 5% of its death row inmates

 - if crack dealing is such a dangerous job and pays so little, why take it?
	- same reason that the pretty girl moves to hollywood, or the quarterback wakes up at 5am to lift weights
	- they all want to succeed in a very competitive field that pays a fortune if you reach the top
		- for many children in the projects, the crack king ping was a highly visible and lucrative job
		- had they grown up under different circumstances, they would have been lawyers or poets
	- a lot of people are competing for a very few prizes
		- becoming the king ping is as likely as becoming an NFL quarterback or movie star

 	- criminals, like everyone else, respond to INCENTIVES
		- if the prize is big enough, they will stand in line just for a chance
	
	- like a MLB pitcher was playing in little league, you must prove yourself at the bottom to be at the top
		- once you come to the sad realization you will never make it to the top, you will quit the race

what makes a job pay well:
 - must factor:
	- unpleasentness of the job
	- demand the job fulfills
	- specialized skills required
 - compare architects and prostitutes:
	- by convention, architects are more educated and skilled than prostitutes, yet why are they paid less?
 	- little girls don't grow up dreaming to be hookers, so there is a small pool of prostitutes
	- their skills aren't specialized, yet meet the other factors
	- they sacrifice safety as well as the opportunity for a stable life
 - demand:
	- why? the architect is more likely to hire a prostitute than vice versa
	- sad reality of our world
