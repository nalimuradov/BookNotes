INTRODUCTION -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

crime in the 90s:
 - all time high, and were projected to be even higher in the future by experts
 - however when it came around, it dropped hard in the 21st century
	- experts began saying that it was gun control or policing strategies that caused this
 - what caused it was norma mccorvey, who won the lawsuit that legalized abortion
	- children are not born equal, and those in poor households have a much higher chance of turning to crime
 	- when these kids weren't being born, the crime rates that were projected never happened

incentives:
 - it's nice to think that experts in a field will do what's best when paid or incentivized
	- you'd like to believe that a real estate agent will do their best to sell your house for top dollar
	- car mechanics will be lenient with fines, as they know there is a higher chance of a returning customer
 - sometimes, this isn't the case:
	- doctors will tend to perform c-sections in growing neighborhoods to ring up a higher bill

 - going back to the real estate example, we can compare how she sells her home vs our home to see if she is being fair
	- seeing as she wants to sell her own home for top dollar and ours as well, it may seem that our goals are aligned
	- however, selling the house for $1000 more will earn you an extra $900 while giving her an extra $90
		- there is not nearly as much benefit to her as there is to you
	- when she's selling her own house, she waits for the best offer
		- when she's selling your house, she encourages you to take the first decent offer

correlation vs causation:
 - just because two things are correlated, doesn't mean one causes the other
 - eg. money wins elections
	- it's true that who spends the most money often wins, but it doesn't mean one causes the other to happen
	- X might cause Y, Y might cause X, but it's also possible that Z might cause both X and Y
 - eg. cities with more police tend to have more murders
	- then you could say that the police cause murders, which makes no sense
	- these facts are correlated, and have no direct relationship with each other

 - there are two scenarios you would donate money in a political campaign typically:
	- if you had $1000k, you would give it if it was close and would make a difference in the decision
	- or give it to the sure fire winner to bask in the glory and get possible rewards when they win
	- what if one candidate was more appealing than the other:
		- and this earned them the votes AND money
		- how would we even measure appeal?

 - to test if money matters, we would need the same candidates running against each other multiple times over and over
	- with varying amounts of money
	- good for us, this has happened in nearly 1000 US congressional races
	- and it turns out, money hardly matters at all
		- a winning candidate can cut his money in half and lose only 1% of the vote
		- a losing candidate who doubles his money can expect to gain 1% of the vote

	- people say that $1 billion being spent on elections every year is so much
		- however it's important to compare things of similar scale
		- for example, the US also spends $1 billion on bubble gum every year

fundamental ideas of the book:
 - incentives are the cornerstone of modern life
 - convential wisdom is often wrong
 - dramatic effects often have distant and subtle causes (eg. norma mccorvey)
 - experts use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda
 - knowing what to measure and how to measure it makes the world much less complicated

1 - SCHOOLTEACHERS AND SUMOWRESTLERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

late daycare pickup:
 - sometimes at a daycare, parents would pick up kids late which would be annoying for the workers
 - economists decided to enact a fine where late pickups would add a charge to the parent
 - as it turns out, the number of late pickups increased substantially with the addition of the fine (opposite of desired effect)
 - economics is simply a study of incentives
	- if you put your hand on the stove, you get burnt
	- if you come home with straight A's, you get a new bike
 	- if you get caught picking your nose, you get ridiculed
	- if you make the basketball team, you go up in the social ladder at school
	- an incentive is simply a means of urging people to do more of a good thing and less of a bad thing
		- however they don't come about organically, we often have to invent them
		- eg. eat all your vegetables, and you get to go to the toy store

incentive types:
 - economic, social, and moral
 - eg. smoking:
	- $3 sin tax creates an economic incentive to not smoke
	- banning of smoking in restaurants creates a social incentive to not smoke
	- when US government says terrorists raise money by selling cigarettes through black market, it creates a moral incentive
 - back to the daycare example:
	- what the fine did was substitute the moral incentive with the economic incentive
		- picking up your child late often brings guilty feelings
		- now they don't feel guilty, as they can just trade their guilt for $3 every day
	- when the fine was removed, now they both didn't have to pay a fine nor feel guilty

 - another example of a moral vs economic incentive:
	- economists wanted to learn about the motivation behind blood donations
	- they found that by giving a small monetary reward for donating blood actually caused fewer people to donate
		- another example of turning a moral incentive into an economic one
	- now they are no longer doing a noble cause, but simply going through a lot of pain to make a few dollars
	- what if we made the monetary incentive very large ($1000):
		- every incentive has its dark side
		- people would begin to steal blood at knife point, or pass of pigs blood as their own
		- a thing worth having is a thing worth cheating for

cheating:
 - anyone will cheat if the stakes are right
	- whether it be a major exam or some small board game with friends
 - for every person who tries to come up with an incentive scheme, there will be another person who will try to cheat it
	- cheating is a primordial act: getting more for less

 - teachers have incentives to cheat too, if their pay/job security is affected by how well their students do
	- they can easily change some marks before submitting without anyone finding out
	- there would be ways to find the cheaters (comparing previous test scores, etc)

sumo wrestling:
 - sumo wrestling consists of 15 rounds, where 8 wins is needed for cutoff
 - how can we prove cheating in sumo wrestling
 - look at games between 8-6 and 7-7 score wrestlers
 	- the 7-7 has so much to gain and the 8-6 has little to lose
 - we expect the 7-7 to win 48% of the time based on their score and their skill
	- however if check data, 7-7 will beat 8-6 nearly 80% of the time
 - what's interesting is their next rematch, the loser of the previous one has an 80% win rate
	- "you let me win this time, i'll let you win next time"
	- after the 2 matches, they return to 50% winrate each
 - when there is scrutiny for rigging, the 7-7 and 8-6 winrates go back to 50%
 - even in the holy sport of sumo wrestling, people cheat

beer on the beach:
 - richard thaler found that a sunbather would pay $2.56 for a beer delivered from the resort hotel
 	- but only $1.50 if it came from a shabby grocery store

feldman bagel experiment:
 - white collar crime is difficult to evaluate, as there is little data
 	- as opposed to murders and robberies which have a victim and info
 - feldman's bagel business provided great insight and data into white collar crimes and cheating
 - smaller companies tended to pay more often
 - the weather also had some effect on how many people paid
 - more people paid after 9/11, likely due to a surge in empathy
 - certain holidays are good while others are bad for cheating, why?
	- thanksgiving and valentines day typically see more people not paying and stealing bagels
	- on the other hand, 4th of july and labor day have more people paying
	- likely because first holidays have other distractions and things to do, while 4th of july is simply a relaxed day off
 - however, we can't ignore that a large majority did pay, and we can't overfocus on the fraction that didn't
	- goodness is inherent, we want to make others feel good
