----------------------- SQL BACKGROUND --------------------------
SQL: language
MySQL: database management system for SQL

DBMS:
 - not the actual databse
 - software that lets you interact with the database
 - can create, read, update, delete (CRUD) information

two types of databases:
 - relational (SQL)
 - non-relational (NoSQL)

relational databases:
 - most popular
 - organize data into 1+ tables
 - tables have rows and columns
 - each row has a unique key

non-relational databases:
 - organize data in anything other than a table
 - eg. JSON, XML, graphs

relational dbms:
 - help users create and maintain a relational database
 - eg. mySQL, oracle, postgreSQL

SQL:
 - standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
 - can perform CRUD operations
 - can define tables and structures

nonrelational dbms:
 - same as relational dbms but for nonrelational
 - no one standard language like SQL
 - eg. mongoDB

queries: 
 - request made to dbms

table:
 - each row is an entry
 - each column is a category

primary key:
 - each table must have one
 - unique values
 - surrogate keys are primary keys that have no mapping to the real world
	- eg. just an arbitrary unique number
 - natural keys are primary keys that have a mapping
	- eg. SSN, or email name
	- they have purposes in the real world

foreign key:
 - a column that is a primary key in another table
 - eg. employees can have a branch_id (1, 2, 3)
 	- the branch table will have branch_id as its primary key
	- therefore, in the employee table, the employee branch is a foreign key
 - tables can have multiple foreign keys
 - foreign keys can also link back to the same table (eg. supervisor_id)

composite key:
 - primary key with more than one column
 - eg. need to two columns to uniquely identify everything
 - branch_id + supplier_name 
 - can be useful to combine primary keys from other tables
	- eg. employee id + client id in a new table
	- can see how much a certain employee sold to a certain client

SQL is a combination of 4 languages:
 - DQL (data query language), get info that is already stored
 - DDL (data definition language), used for defining database schema
 - DCL (data control language), control access to the data in database
 - DML (data manipulation language), used for inserting, updatind, deleting data in the database

queries:
 - set of instructions given to DBMS that tells it what info you want to retrieve
 - eg. SELECT employee.name, employee.age FROM employee WHERE employee.salary > 30000

----------------------- MAKING TABLES --------------------------

to use MySQL:
 - open mysql command line editor

popSQL:
 - text editor that connects to database
 - makes it look nice

create database nariman:
 - creates a database with name nariman

types of data we can store:
 - INT			(whole numbers)
 - DECIMAL(M,N)		(decimal numbers)
 - VARCHAR(l)		(string of length l)
 - BLOB			(binary large object)
 - DATE			('YYYY-MM-DD')
 - TIMESTAMP		('YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS')

eg. DECIMAL(10,4):
 - store a number with 10 total digits, and four of those coming after the decimal point

CREATE TABLE student (
	student_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
	name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	major VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'undecided'
);
 - initializes a table called 'student'

NOT NULL:
 - specifies an item in the table to be not null

UNIQUE:
 - specifies an item in the column must be unique
 - a primary key is basically an attribute that is both NOT NULL and UNIQUE

DEFAULT:
 - specifies a default value if none is given

AUTO_INCREMENT:
 - will automatically increment that column
 - now we no longer have to insert with it
 - INSERT INTO student(name,major) VALUES('n', 'jo')
	- must do this way with auto increment

DESCRIBE student:
 - describes the table

DROP TABLE student:
 - deletes the table

ALTER TABLE student ADD gpa DECIMAL(3,2);
 - used to edit a table after making it
 - adds a column 'gpa' of type DECIMAL(3, 2)
 - ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN gpa;

FOREIGN KEY:
 - CREATE TABLE branch (
	branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	mgr_id INT, 
	mgr_start_date DATE,
	FOREIGN KEY(mgr_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
   )

to change a table value into a foreign key:
 - ALTER TABLE employee
   ADD FOREIGN KEY(super_id)
   REFERENCES employee(emp_id)
   ON DELETE SET NULL;

CREATE TABLE works_with (
	emp_id INT,
	client_id INT,
	total_sales INT,
	PRIMARY KEY(emp_id,client_id)
	FOREIGN KEY(emp_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
	FOREIGN KEY(client_id) REFERENCES client(client_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
	- two primary keys that are each foreign keys too
	- on delete CASCADE

ON DELETE:
 - set null: when deleted, set values that reference it to NULL
	- eg. delete emp_id = 102
	- now in branch table, will have NULL where the mgr_id is (was 102)
	- a lot of supervisor_id's are now NULL too
 - cascade: when deleted, remove the entire row and shift everything up
	- eg. if we delete branch 2
	- all rows in branch_supplier with branch_id 2 ALSO get deleted
	- useful when deleting a foreign key
		- other table can't have NULL as its primary key, must delete

----------------------- POPULATING TABLES --------------------------

inserting each row is just done one by one like the line below
INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, 'nariman', 'engineering');
 - adds data to tables
 - must add it in the same order as the schema (student_id -> name -> major)

to get the data we just uploaded:
 - SELECT * FROM student;

inputting a new row without all the data:
 - say we want to add a row of a student without a major
 - INSERT INTO student VALUES (3, 'narman', NULL)

UPDATING ROWS:
 - UPDATE student
   SET major = 'Bio'
   WHERE major = 'Biology' OR major = 'Chemistry';
 - will change every row with 'Biology' or 'Chemistry' to 'Bio'

 - UPDATE student
   SET name = 'TOM', major = 'Opt'
   WHERE student_id = 1;

 - if no WHERE statement, will apply to every row

careful when inserting:
 - if a row in a table has a foreign key, must first initialize it as NULL
 - and then input it after that foreign key value created in the other table
 - otherwise it has nothing to reference to (eg. branch_id of 1 when that doesn't exist yet)

 - once all the complicated relationships done, can simply insert as regular
 - INSERT INTO works_with VALUES(105, 400, 100);

DELETING ROWS:
 - DELETE FROM student 
	- just this line will delete every row
 - DELETE FROM student 
   WHERE student_id = 5 AND major = 'undecided';

----------------------- RETRIEVING DATA --------------------------

SELECT * FROM student; (get whole table)

SELECT name FROM student; (get all names)

retrieving data from multiple tables:
 - with more tables, may need to specify what table a column is from
 - eg. SELECT student.name FROM student;

ordering the queries:
 - SELECT name FROM student ORDER BY name DESC;
 - add desc to return in descending order

 - SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY major, student_id;
	- will order by major first, then student_id if any common majors

limit number of results:
 - SELECT * FROM student LIMIT 2;
 - will only return 2 results
 - can order and then limit

WHERE example:
 - SELECT * FROM student WHERE major = 'Chemistry' or name = 'Barn'

WHEREIN:
 - SELECT * FROM student WHERE IN ('john', 'steve') AND student_id > 2;
 - can use when multiple classes we want to fit in

AS keyword:
 - can rename a column as something else when it is retrieved
 - eg. SELECT last_name AS surname;

DISTINCT keyword:
 - gets all unique values for that column
 - eg. SELECT DISTINCT sex FROM employee;
	- will return a table with M, F

***EXAMPLES***

employees ordered by salary:
 - SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary;

employees ordered by sex, then name:
 - SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY sex, last_name, first_name;

first 5 employees in the table:
 - SELECT * FROM employee LIMIT 5;

get first and last names of all employees:
 - SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employee;

get first name and call it forename and get last name and call it surname:
 - SELECT first_name AS forename, last_name AS surname FROM employee;

----------------------- SQL functions --------------------------

can use when retrieving data thru queries
 - COUNT, AVG, SUM, GROUP BY

COUNT() function:
 - eg. find the number of employees:
	- SELECT COUNT(emp_id) FROM employee;
	- will return number of employees (because emp_id is primary key)

get number of female employees born after 1970:
 - SELECT COUNT(emp_id) FROM employee WHERE sex = 'F' AND birth_date > '1970-01-01';

AVG() function:
 - eg. find the average of all male employee salaries:
 	- SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee WHERE sex = 'M';

SUM() function:
 - adds up all the values in the column

GROUP BY aggregation:
 - eg. find the number of males and females
 	- SELECT COUNT(sex), sex FROM employee GROUP BY sex;
	- will return num of males and num of females

find the total sales of each salesman:
 - SELECT SUM(total_sales), emp_id FROM works_with GROUP BY emp_id;

*** AGGREGATION IMPORTANT ***

wildcards:
 - % for any number of characters
 - _ for one character

find any client who have 'LLC' in their name:
 - SELECT * FROM client WHERE client_name LIKE '%LLC';
	- has to end with 'LLC'
	- if 'LLC' should be somewhere in the middle, do '%LLC%'

LIKE keyword:
 - use these wildcards to filter based on things like string patterns
 - very similar to REGEX

find any branch suppliers who are in the label business:
 - SELECT * FROM branch_supplier WHERE supplier_name LIKE '%label%';

find any employee born in october:
 - SELECT * FROM employee WHERE birth_date LIKE '____-10-__'

----------------------- UNIONS --------------------------

unions:
 - allow combining multiple SELECT statements into one
 - must be same number of columns in both SELECT statements
 - must also be of same data type
 - basically combines two SELECT statements

eg. find a list of employee and branch names
 - SELECT first_name AS all_names
   FROM employee
   UNION
   SELECT branch_name 
   FROM branch;
	- will return one list containing employees and branch names

eg. find a list of all money spent and earned by the company
 - SELECT salary AS all_money
   FROM employee
   UNION
   SELECT total_sales
   FROM works_with;

----------------------- JOINS --------------------------

joins:
 - used to combine tables through a related column between them
 - this basic join is also known as an INNER JOIN
	- will combine rows whenever they have shared column in column

eg. find all branches and a list of their managers
 - SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch,branch_names
   FROM employee
   JOIN branch
   ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;

left join:
 - include all rows from left table
 - will have lots of NULL values for rows that don't have matches
 - eg. included ALL employees even though they weren't managers
	- all employees included

right join:
 - include  all rows from right table
 - opposite of above (eg. included BUFFALO branch even though had no manager)
	- all branches included

outer join:
 - combination of above
	- all employees AND all branches included
	- SELECT * FROM table1 OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.x = table2.y

----------------------- NESTED QUERIES --------------------------

nested queries:
 - useful when we need to obtain parts of information from multiple places
 - important to include table names as there may be overlapping column names

find names of all employees who have sold over 30 000 to a single client
 - SELECT works_with.emp_id FROM works_with WHERE works_with.total_sales > 30000;
 - SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name FROM employee WHERE ???
 - this is where use nested

 - SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name 
   FROM employee 
   WHERE employee.emp_id IN (
	SELECT works_with.emp_id
	FROM works_with
	WHERE works_with.total_sales > 30000);

eg. find all clients who are handled by Michael Scott's branch
 - find branch_id Michael manages
 - then we can use that in the client table
 - SELECT branch.branch_id FROM branch WHERE mgr_id = 102;
	- now use this in the below one
 - SELECT client.client_name FROM client WHERE client.branch_id = (???)

 - SELECT client.client_name 
   FROM client 
   WHERE client.branch_id = (
	SELECT branch.branch_id 
	FROM branch 
	WHERE mgr_id = 102
	LIMIT 1
   );
	- limit because we need to make sure we can only have 1 for the '='

----------------------- TRIGGERS --------------------------

trigger:
 - defines an action that is performed when a certain operation is performed on database
 - must be defined in CMD (need to change delimiter)

eg. CREATE TABLE trigger_Test (message VARCHAR(100));

DELIMITER $$
CREATE
    TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT
    ON employee
    FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
	INSERT INTO trigget_test VALUES('added new employee');
    END$$
DELIMITER ;

 - above inserts values into trigger_test whenever row added to employee table
 - the delimiter allows us to make multi line tings
	- otherwise SQL will think we're done at the first semi-colon
	- this way we can write that block and then end with delimiter

 - now if we add a new employee and then:
	- SELECT * FROM trigger_test
	- will show the message in the table


conditionals in triggers:
 - can do if else statements

DELIMITER $$
CREATE
    TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT
    ON employee
    FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
	IF NEW.sex = 'M' THEN
	    INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added male employee');
	ELSEIF NEW.sex = 'F' THEN
	    INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added female employee');
	ELSE 
	    INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added other employee');
	END IF;
    END$$
DELIMITER ;

----------------------- ER DIAGRAMS --------------------------

entity relationship diagrams

entity:
 - an object we want to model and whose info we want to store
 - can have multiple entities in a diagram
 - eg. a student
 - represented as a square

attributes:
 - specifies info about entities
 - eg. age
 - represented as small ovals around entitiy

 - **the primary key attribute is underlined

composite attributes:
 - attribute that can be broken up into sub-attributes
 - eg. name -> fname, lname
 - break off main attribute as more attributes

multivalued attributes:
 - attribute that can have more than one value
 - eg. clubs (more than 1)
 - represented as double oval

derived attributes:
 - attribute that can be derived from other attributes
 - eg. has honors, can be derived from the GPA attribute
 - we don't actually keep track of this attribute
 - represented as dotted oval

entity relationships:
 - eg. [student] TAKES [class]
 	- student entity TAKES a class entity
 - represented as a diamond

 - lines that connect to relationship are important
	- single line implies partial participation (not all students need to take a class)
 	- double line imples total participation (all classes must be taken by students)
 - two entities can share multiple relationships
 - one entity can also have a relationship with itself 
	- eg. employee with 'supervision' relationship

relationship attributes:
 - an attribute to a relationship
 - eg. TAKES can have a 'grade' attribute
	- student will take a class and get a particular grade
	- attribute is reliant on this relationship, not the individual entities

relationship cardinality:
 - number of instances of an entity from a relation that can be associated with the relation
 - 1:1, 1:N, N:M
 - one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many
 - eg. any number of students can take a class
	- also any number of classes can be taken by a student
	- therefore it is an N:M, many-to-many relationship
	
weak entity:
 - an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone
 - it depends on another entity
 - eg. EXAM entity depends on the CLASS entity (without class no exam)

identifying relationship:
 - relationship that serves to uniquely identify the weak entity
 - eg. class HAS exam
 - represented as double diamond

eg. employee can work for one branch at a time
 - BRANCH ----1---> works for <---N---- EMPLOYEE

converting ER diagrams into databases:
 - take all regular entities and map them to tables with their attributes
 - for weak entities, take the primary key of what its weak to and add as primary key
 - for 1:1 relationships, include one side of the relationship as a foreign key in the other
	- favor total participation (if one has and one doesn't, use one which has)
 - for 1:N relationships, inclide 1-sides primary key as a foreign key in the N-side
	- eg. if branch is 1, emp is N, include branch_id as a foreign key in employee
 - for M:N relationships, make a new table whose primary key is a combo of both entities' primary keys
	- also, include any relationship attributes
	- eg. the 'works_on' table
