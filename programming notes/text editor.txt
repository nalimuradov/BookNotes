Text Editor Notes

word processor vs text editor
 - WISIWYG
 - word processor is like microsoft word
 - text editor everything must be done manuall (latex)

vim
 - widely used text editor
 - has two modes (insertion and normal)
 - type vim into terminal to run

shell
 - program that supplies the command line
 - most common is BASH

open vim
 - vim .bash_profile
 - type i to go to insert mode and then enter text
 - press ESC to return to normal mode
 - can move around using arrows keys, or 0 and $ 

Colon
 - some vim commands start with :
 - usually with file manipulation
 - can quit using :q
 - add ! at end to override and quit (:q!)

Undo
 - ESC then u to undo a previous step

write
 - type :w to write to file
 - can then source .bash_profile to make it work *** 

Can Make Shortcuts like this
 - instead of typying grep -i etc, can make it shorter
 - alias g = 'grep -i'

Delete
 - can delete text by clicking 'x' in normal mode over the character to delete
 - to delete a line, press 'dd' in normal mode
 - can then paste that line using 'p'

Larger Files
 - Ctrl-F and Ctrl-B move by page (Forward and Backward)
 - G goes to end of file and 1G to go to start

Search
 - /<string>
 - press n to go to the next match
 - (number)G goes to the line "number" of the file 
 	- eg. 18G goes to line 18 of file
