3 - Behavioral Evolution II

infanticide:
 - prior to 1970's, humans were thought to be only ones who kill for pleasure
 - killing infants was unheard of among animals
 - lions and monkeys in india have been found to kill infants
	- among animals, tends to be adult males who do the killing
	- typically kill the offspring of other males
 - happens among species where birth period is longer than high-rank male tenure
	- eg. new male wants to be leader
	- females just gave birth, not gonna ovulate for 3 years so no births until then
	- the new male will most likely be leader for max 1 year, so can't mate
	- will go and kill offspring of other male
		- if child dies, female may begin ovulating again
 - eg. rats
	- when new rat shows up, the smell of new male rat causes pregnant females to miscarry
	- females choose to do this
		- better to miscarry by choice than by force
	- UNLESS successor is close relative to male

 - the older the female, the more willing she is to put her life at risk for the child
	- maternal grandmother willing to defend for child 

 - female defense:
	- to protect against new male, female can pretend she is ovulating
	- will pretend their child is the new males child

 - kidnapping:
	- if low ranking male must fight high ranking male
	- when scared, the weaker male will grab an infant and hold hostage
	- the infant is most likely the stronger males
	- this is a conscious effort 

birthing male vs female:
 - for a tournament species:
	- if give birth to male, high chance won' father kids but small chance will father many kids
	- if give birth to female, will give birth to 1 to 5 kids (safer option)

adelphic polyandry:
 - reverse harem
 - female may mate with multiple males
 - eg. sometimes lion herds have two male lions (brothers)

intersexual competition:
 - males and females have different reproductive strategies
	- causes competition between sexes
 - there is a genetic mechanism that makes genes work differently depeneding on which parent it comes from
 - males have genes that speed up fetal development, females have genes that slow it down
	- they don't have overlapping reproductive strategies

monkey exogamy:
 - among baboons, males emigrate at puberty and females all relatives
 - among chimps, females emigrate at puberty and males all relatives
	- baboons have higher intra-male aggression 
		- none of the males are related
 	- chimps work together better
		- kill other males from other groups

founder effect:
 - this is a model to jumpstart cooperation in populations
 - say we have population of animals, and we isolate a small portion of them
 - the small portion will have more inbreeding:
	- they will be more related to each other 
	- this will lead to greater cooperation
 - when the small group is reintroduced to original group:
	- they will outcompete everyone else due to teamwork
	- others will be forced to cooperate with them to stand a chance

group selection:
 - two groups: aggressive chickens and calm chickens
	- individually, an aggressive chicken will lay more eggs than a calm chicken
	- in a group of aggressive chickens:
		- they will all stress each other out and lay fewer eggs
	- in a group of calm chickens:
		- they won't attack each other and lay more eggs
 - an example of a trait that works better in a group

ways to explain all of behavior, biology, social sciences:
 - heritability of traits:
	- there is heritability to kidnap infants of other males	
	- there is heritability to decide you like big plumage
 - adaptiveness:
	- if some trait has emerged, there is an adaptive explanation for it
 - gradualism:
	- processes of evolutionary change are gradual

spandrils
 - something that is there as a byproduct
 - eg. chins:
	- humans didn't evolve chins for a certain task
	- we couldn't develop our certain face without the chin
		- it was a byproduct of other traits
