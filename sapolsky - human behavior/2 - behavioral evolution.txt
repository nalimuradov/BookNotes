2 - Behavioral Evolution

darwin:
 - didn't discover evolution
 - rather he came up with the mechanism of evolution: natural selection

key points in darwinism:
 - traits are heritable (can pass on traits)
 - there is variability in these traits
 - some versions of those traits are better than others

 - it's not about survival, it's about reproduction
 - over time, the better versions become commonplace
 - couldn't behavior work the same way?
	- there are different behaviors, some are better than others

species and evolution:
 - 'how do giraffes know they need a heart this big?'
 - 'why do cherry trees act a certain way when it's cold?'
 	- nobody wants to do it, it's just evolution
	- otherwise, they wouldn't have survived all this time

"animals act for the greater good of the species":
 - this is a common misconception
 - eg. wildebeest sacrificing himself to crocodiles so that young ones can cross river
	- people tend to think he is doing it for the greater good
	- in reality, he is pushed to the front by others because he's old

natural selection vs sexual selection:
 - big moose antlers for fighting is natural selection
 - having random traits that serve no purpose but that the other gender likes is sexual selection
	- eg. having weird designs on body (useless but attractive)

siblings/twins:
 - we share so many genes that we are willing to sacrifice our time and energy
	- sacrfice energy so that they get a greater chance of passing on genes
 - animals are obsessed with kinship

rock-paper-scissors scenario:
 - say we have 3 species: A, B, C
	- A can damage B but it costs C, B can damage C but it costs A, C can damage A but it costs B
 - this will cause an equilibirum where no one will damage one another

 - eg. bacteria A could make a poison, the cost is it had to make that poison (effort)
	- bacteria B was vulnerable to poison as it had a transporter, but it is able to absorb more food too
	- bacteria C didn't have to spend energy on poison, but it doesn't have transporter
 - these 3 strains of bacteria are competing with each other
	- they realize they can't be aggressive as if they damage one, they're more vulnerable to the other
	- this creates a natural stalemate
   	- they actually end up cooperating with eachother, even though they aren't relatives

so why help anyone if they arent relatives?
 - wouldn't it be better to backstab everyone else?
 - in some cases, many hands make the task light
	- eg. hunting in groups, higher likelihood of kill

reciprocal altruism:
 - works better in long-lived smart vertebrates
 - higher chance of seeing the individual you helped again later

cheating:
 - we are attuned to picking up cheating
 - people are more likely to notice when they got cheated than to notice when they get 
 - test where some people got a blessing rather than being punished for failed task
 - test where some people got punished rather than blessed for a successful task
 - way more noticed getting cheated

game theory:
 - there are games with mathematical optimizations
	- strategies when to cooperate and when to defect
	- when to help and when to not
 - prisoners dilemma is a popular example

optimal prisoners dilemma:
 - ideal strategy is 'tit for tat':
 	- cooperate initially
 	- continue cooperating until they cheat, in which case you cheat
 	- if they cooperate after, you go back to cooperating
	- doesn't work as well if there is a signal error 

forgiving tit for tat:
 - like 'tit for tat' but tries to avoid signal error
 	- be forgiving for 1 round 
 	- solves error problem
 - vulnerable to tit for tat, they can abuse the forgiveness factor
 - to solve: start with tit for tat
	- if and only if other individual doesn't cheat for long time:
		- go to forgiving tit for tat

stickleback fish experiment:
 - putting mirror in the fish tank makes the fish think its reflection is a threat
 - now put a mirror perpendicular to fish, it will think it has a teammate in this fight
 - if we angle the perpendicular mirror slightly, it will think its 'partner' (reflection) is cheating
	- his 'teammate' will appear to be farther back and thus 'cheating'
 - the fish will notice this and start to hold back and 'cheat' too, 'tit for tat'

naked mole rats:
 - they have role diversification:
	- some rats get more food, but they have to plug the entrance hole from predators with their asses

big male skull, small female skull species:
 - higher aggression, big males
 - dont take care of the kids

small male skull, small female skull species:
 - female-like males
 - parental
