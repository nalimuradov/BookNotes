ytAPI project layout

things to extract:
 - thumbnail bitmap
 - title
 - viewcount
 - subcount 
 - postfreq

training_data:
 - obtained from API
 - store locally (efficiently)

UI:
 - flask restAPI for model
 - allows for input data:
	- thumbnail
	- title
 - facts and disclaimers on site

models:
 - input: string or bitmap
 - output: 1.08

example training data:
 - thumbnail = [0 0 0 ... 0 1 0]
 - title = "this is a sample title"
 - view = 10000
 - sub = 20000
 - postfreq = 150
 
label = [view*log(uploads in past year)]/sub

TODO:
 - get postfreq from youtube API
 - extract and store data more efficiently
 - base img model layout create
 - develop flask UI endpoint
