Christian Rudder - Dataclysm

differences between what you want, what you say, and what you do:
 - aggregate data shows that men want women ages 20-23 (across all ages of men)
 - however when asked, they say they want someone near their age
 - however again, they mostly message women slightly younger than them (gap widens as older)

however for women:
 - they prefer men slightly older than them (at all ages)
 - as such, women have it harder in that the clock is ticking quick time for them
 - for every 100 men interested in a 20yo, there are only 9 interested in a 50yo
 
popularity of being polarizing:
 - john waters appears more in profiles than spielberg and george lucas combined
 - either you love it or hate it
 - repelling some people draws others closer 
 - being universally liked is to be relatively ignored
 - however being disliked by some is to be loved all the more by others
 
 - similarly, a women's attractiveness is enhanced when some men find her ugly
 - eg. rating from 1 to 5 -> avg will be 3 if all voted 3 or half voted 1 and other half voted 5
 - the second one has greater variance
 - the greater the variance the better
 - being polarizing will get you 70% more matches 
 - people not liking you brings you more attention on its own
 
 - biological logic:
      - a man seeing an unconvential women may think that other men are likely turned off
      - as such, he assumes there is less comptetition, increasing his chance of success
      - "i bet she doesn't meet many guys who think she's awesome, this is my diamond in the rough, etc...."
      - on the other hand, broad appeal from an attractive woman will make you think there is more competition
      
 - pratfall effect:
      - as long as you're generally competent, making a small, occasianal mistake makes people think you're more competent
      - flaws call out the good stuff all the more
      - smell of indole in perfumes and flowers, "a little bit of shit brings the bees"
