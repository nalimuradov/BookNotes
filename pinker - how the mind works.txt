Pinker - How the Mind Works

robots:
 - we as humans undermine everything our brain can do
 - a robot 'sees' numbers and process them
 - difficult for a robot to process images (edge or shadow?)
	- say robots had a number for each pixel of light (bigger is lighter, small is dark)
 	- big numbers beside smaller numbers can mean different objects or just lighting

limbs:
 - a human's hands, feet, arms are miraculous
 - the precision and coordination between the brain and the limbs is very advanced
	- this would be extremely difficult for a robot to replicate

common sense:
 - our mind is also very good at categorizing objects and concepts
 - bachelor example:
	- what is a bachelor? a man who has never married 
	- what about a 17 year old boy who lives at home with parents
	- what about a 17 year old boy who left home at 13 to start a business
		- became successful and is now a playboy
	- what about a couple with a child who hasn't married?
		- wouldn you call the man in that relationship a bachelor?
 - humans have common sense, machines don't
 - a big thing we take for granted
	- eg. if you were alive at 9am and at 5pm, we assume you were alive at noon that day
	- robots don't implicitly know that
	- eg. if i left milk carton in car, we can say there is 1 gallon of milk in car
		- if i am sitting in car, is it fair to say there is 1 gallon of blood in car?

mind-body problem:
 - how to connect world of meaning and intention with the physical world
 - wanting to go to the store has no physical properties
 - but it is a cause of a physical event just like a pool ball hitting another ball
 
 - we can't look at a patch of the brain and see the intricate logic
 - we can't say all our brains the same because they look the same
 - must look at patterns, connections, neurons
	- eg. a book is just the same 75 characters, the order is what makes it different from other books

computational theory of the mind:
 - theory that says beliefs and desires are information
	- these are incarnated as symbols, or bits, like in a computer
	- these bits bump into muscle and behavior happens

common sense:
 - isn't common for robots
 - eg. if there is a carton of milk in the car, we can say there is a gallon of milk in the car
 	- if i'm sitting in a car, we don't typically say there is a gallon of blood in the car
	- robots wouldn't know this
 - eg. bachelor example
	- what is a bachelor? someone who hasn't married
	- many edge cases, such as young boy who goes to school
	- what about couple with children who hasn't married?

 - wise men marvel at the commonplace
	- astounded by the wonders of hands land legs
	- hands can grip in all kinds of ways
	- by walking, we are constantly tipping over and catching ourselves

 - for robots to have common sense, they must consider all side effects of actions
	- but then must also consider which actions are relevant

brain:
 - the brain is like a book
 - can't look at it piece by piece, must look at as a whole
 - the same way we can't look at individual letters in a book to understand it, must look at the bigger picture

intelligence difference:
 - the difference between einstein and a dropout is a fraction of the difference between dropout and best robot

genes:
 - there are genes for disorders like dyslexia, etc
 - there are no genes for language, memory, intelligence, civility

wrong questions being asked:
 - people ask wrong questions when it comes to finding why something is the way it is for human society
 - eg. why is music popular? 
	- the copout answer is it brings the community together
 - the proper question to ask is "why should the community be together in the first place?"

reverse engineering:
 - best way to understand anything is reverse engineering it
 - eg. purpose of pregnancy sickness?
	- some foods may contain toxins that can harm fetus during critical points of development
	- body reacts and tries to avoid it

DNA similarities:
 - common saying is that chimps and humans share 99% of the same DNA
 - goes to show that the small 1% difference can make all the difference
 - while we inhabit every biome and thrive, chimps are struggling to survive as a species

darwinian suicide:
 - if our goal is to pass on our genes, why do some people adopt or practice celibacy?
	- our behaviours are still like that of foragers years ago
	- we have evolved too fast as a species for our behaviours
 - what evolved was our mind, not our behaviour

spreading genes:
 - people don't spread genes, genes spread themselves
	- we are their tools 
	- they do it by making us enjoy life, sex, friends
	- as such, these are OUR primary goals in life

 - sexual desire is not peoples strategy to propogate genes
	- it's peoples strategy to attain pleasures of sex
	- the pleasures of sex are the genes strategy to propogate themselves
	- if they don't get propogated, we outsmarted them (eg. condoms, bcp)

selfish genes:
 - selfish genes don't imply selfish organisms
 - maybe the most selfish thing to do is to build a selfless brain

turing machine:
 - can produce same outputs given the same inputs as any program
 - assuming speed and size were irrelevant

thoughts:
 - our thoughts are not in english, they are in mentalese
 - english can be ambiguous whereas our thoughts aren't

science and ethics:
 - they are two self-contained terms that are played out among the same entities in the world
 - similar to how bridge and poker are both played with the same 52-card deck

idealizations:
 - free will and ethical theory is an idealization, just like euclidean geometry
 - there are no perfect circles and infinite lines in our world, but these idealizations are still useful to us

intelligence:
 - intelligence is the ability to attain goals in the face of obstacles
	- by means of decision based on rules

 - humans are intelligent, we have desires and we pursue them with beliefs
 - romeo and juliet example:
	- they are not like magnets
	- if you put wall in between, they will find way around
	- rather than clanging against wall like magnets
