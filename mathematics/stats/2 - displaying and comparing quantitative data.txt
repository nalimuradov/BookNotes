2 - Displaying and Comparing Quantitative Data

frequency tables:
 - PETS | COUNT
---------------------
   dogs	|  10
   cats	|   8
  bears	|  11

histogram:
 - same as bar graph but instead of categorical variables we have continious variables represented as buckets
 - eg. age ranges

stem and leaf plot:
 - STEM | LEAF
      0 | 0 0 2 4 7 7 9
      1 | 1 1 3 8
      2 | 0
 - the stem represents the tens digit and the leafs represent the ones digit
	- eg. 00, 00, 02, 04, 07, 09, etc.
	- two players with 0 points, one play with 2 points, etc.

shapes of distributions:
 - left-tailed
 - right-tailed
 - symmetrical

box plot:
 - left and right dots indicate min and max value
 - the box itself represents the middle 50%
 - the line in the box represents the median

when to use which plot:
 - box plots are useful to find minimum, maximum, median
 - histograms are useful to find how many items are greater/less than a certain value
