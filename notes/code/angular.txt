Angular Notes

angular:
 - used to build powerful single page applications
 - its like html but for dynamic sites
 - frontend/clientside framework

why use it?
 - rapid development and code generation
 - code organization
 - dynamic content in the html templates
 - cross platform (windows, mac, linux) (chrome, firefox, edge)

typescript:
 - angular uses typescript, a superset of javascript
 - offer static typing, class-based OOP
 - angular components are essentially classes themselves
 - like java but with javascript

components:
 - sections of the user interface
 - eg. navbar component, blog post component, etc
 - basic building block of the application
 - appComponent is the main one
 - import, decorator, component classs

decorator:
 - allows us to import meta data
 - selector: custom html tag to insert component
 - template: html
 
services:
 - used to share data and functionality across multiple components
 - can inject services into components to use
 - good place for ajax calls

create ng app:
 - ng new 'name'
 - ng serve to run it

files in the application:
 - package.json: manifest of the app, version, dependencies, scripts, etc
 - app folder is the bulk of our application

------------------------------------------------------

it is a frontend/client side js framework:
 - runs on users browser as opposed to a webserver
 - used to build powerfule single page applications

MEAN stack:
 - mongoDB
 - express
 - angular
 - node.js

HTML vs angular:
 - angular is what HTML woulda been if created for dynamic applications

why use angular?
 - routing, event handling, validation very fast and efficient
 - can have dynamic content in the html (using directives)
 - it is cross platform and has unit testing built in

CORE FEATURES OF ANGULAR:
 - components
 - services
 - routing
 - testing
 - build tools
 - data binding
 - templating
 - http module
 - observables
 - forms module
 - directives
 - pipes
 - events
 - animation
 - typescript

typescript?
 - a superset of javascript (includes everything and more from regular js)
 - static typing (can define if int, bool, etc)
 - can create class-based objects (like in java)

components:
 - basic building block of an application
 - appcomponent is the base one, every angular app has one

services:
 - share data across multiple components
 - all services use the Injectable package

angular-cli json file:
 - if you wanna load stylesheets, scripts, etc

app.modyle.ts:
 - components go in declarations
 - modules go into imports
 - services go into providers
 - the main component goes into bootstrap

add a component
 - ng g component components/user
 - creates new component in directory

ngOnInit()
 - runs when component is initialized

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - to install [npm install -g @angular/cli]
 - to create workspace [ng new my-app]

ng new my-app:
 - creates workspace with root folder, my-app
 - creates initial skeleton app project, also called my-app [src folder]
 - creates end2end test project (in e2e folder)
 - initial project has a ready to run 'Welcome app'

to run:
 - cd into the project
 - type [ng serve --open], open opens the browser by itself

components:
 - building blocks of angular apps
 - display data, listen for user input, and take action based on input

in the src file:
 - there are 3 appcomponent files: html, css, ts
 - html is what is displayed, css as usual, and ts has title data

{{title}}
 - can put this in html
 - this is interpolation binding syntax
 - displays the components title valye inside the tag its placed in

to generate new components:
 - ng generate component compname

component ts file:
 - selector: the component's CSS element selector
 - templateURL: location of components template file
 - styleURLs: location of components CSS styles
 - always export the component class (so other classes can import)

selectors:
 - must add selector in html file so it knows my g
