Fundamentals of RDBMS and Database Designs
 - client: PCs, macs, tablets, etc
 - server: stores files
 - network: communication link between client and server

 - relational database model:
	- tables: real world entity
		- eg. address: zip code, number, street, city
	- column: activity of the table
		- eg. the zip codes
	- row: set of values for a signle instance of an entity
		- eg. 2014 forest hills drive
	- cell: an individual value of an entity
		- eg. milton

 - primary key:
	- unique identifier, one per table, NOT NULL
	- can be a combination of columns
		- those columns become 'composite columns'
	- student# is a good primary key as each student has a unique number

 - unique key:
	- ensures data is not duplicate
	- similar to primary key but allows NULL

 - foreign key:
	- columns in a table that refers to a primary key in another table
	- can have one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many relationship
	- people and addresses:
		- one-to-one: one person has one address and one address has one person
		- one-to-many: one person has many addresses (work, home)
		- one-to-many: one address has many people (family)
		- many-to-many: multiple people have multiple addresses (family members working at same place)

 - column data types:
	- string: CHAR, VARCHAR
	- integer: INT
	- float: FLOAT
	- date and time: DATE

 - default value:
	- can create a new row of type DATE and assign current date and time as default value, or can put NULL
	- can update later
