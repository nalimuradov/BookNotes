sentiment analysis:
 - the extaction of sentiment
 - the positive/negative orientation that writer expresses
 - eg. review of a movie
 - simplest sentiment analysis:
	- binary classification: eg. greatly/awesome vs trash/awful
	- spam detection is another simple example (key spam words)

classification:
 - extremely useful to classify data into buckets
 - generative classifiers (naive bayes):
	- return class most likely to have generated the observation
 - discriminative classifiers (logistic regression):
 	- learn what features from input are most useful to distinguis between possible classes

naive bayes:
 - we can calculate the class of a document by:
	- c = max(P(d|c) * P(c))
		- removed denom because it's the same for each class
	- to find the class, we need the prior probability of the class P(c) and the likelihood of the doc P(d|c)

 - we can also represent document d as a set of features f1 to fn
	- c = max(P(f1, f2, .. | c) * P(c))

 - to simplify, we ignore the word positions and only care about count
	- we also assume that probabilities of features are independent of each other
	- this is why it's called NAIVE bayes

 - naive bayes calculations are also done in log space (like language modeling) to avoid underflow
 - it is a linear classifier:
	- classifiers that use a linear combination of the inputs to make a classification decision
