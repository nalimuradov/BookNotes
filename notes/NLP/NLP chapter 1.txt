regular expression:
 - used to specify strings we want to extract from a document

text normalization: 
 - converting text to a more convenient form (eg. tokenizing)

tokenization: 
 - seperating text into 'tokens'
 - typically words separated by white space, but not always
 - eg. 'New York' could be one token, and 'I'm' could be split into two tokens 'I am'
 - for tweets, a good token to track could be :) for smile emote, or a hashtag

lemmatization:
 - task of determining that two words have the same root
 - words 'sang', 'sung', 'sing' are all forms of the same verg 'sing'
	- 'sing' is the common lemma
 - useful for complex languages like arabic

corpus :
 - a collection of written texts or speech

regular expressions:
 - /woodchuck/ will find any matches containint substring 'woodchuck'
	- case sensitive so will not match with 'Woodchuck'
 - /a/ will find anything with an 'a' in it
 - /[wW]oodchuck/ lowercase and uppercase
 - /[abc]/ anything with any of these letters in it
 - /[1234567890]/ any number
	- writing out all numbers or all letters can get long
 	- as such, can write /[0-9]/
 - for any letter, /[A-Z]/

 - use a caret ^ to specify NOT
 - /[^A-Z]/ means not an uppercase letter
 - /[^sS]/ means neither 's' or 'S'

 - ? represents 'or nothing'
 - eg. /woodchucks?/ will return either 'woodchuck' or 'woodchucks'
 - eg. /colou?r/ will return either 'color' or 'colour'

 - asterisk used to represent zero or more instances of something
 - /a*/ will match with anything with zero or more a's, so pretty much everything
 - for one ore more a's, /aa*/

 - period is an expression for 'wildcard'
 - /beg.n/ will match 'begin', 'begun', 'began'

 - period and asterisk can be combined to perform very useful tasks
 	- eg. /aardvark.*aardvark/ will find any line where 'aardvark' appears twice

 - \b matches a word boundary, \B matches a non-boundary
	- thus, /\bthe\b/ will match 'the' but not 'other'

 - disjunction operator is like OR
	- /cat|dog/ will search for either 'cat' or 'dog'

 - parentheses to perform operations on certain parts of text
 	- eg. /gupp(y|ies)/ will search for either 'guppy' or 'guppies'
 	- very useful with asterisk * to find all matches of a string
	- /the*/ will match 'theeee' and /(the)*/ will match 'thethe'

 - curly braces indicate exact count of something
	- /a{3}/ will search for exactly 3 occurences of 'a'
	- /a{3,5}/ will search for 3 to 5 occurences of 'a'
 
 - use backslash to search for meta words like '*' (eg. \*)

 - some common keywords like \b:
	- \d will find any digit
	- \D will find any non-digit
	- \w will find any alphanumeric value
	- \W will find any non-alphanumeric value
	- \s will find any white space
	- \S will find any non-white space

 - regex substitution:
	- s/colour/color/ will replace 'colour' with 'color'

 - example: the Xer they were, the Xer they will be
	- we want to check where X is the same word
	- s/([0-9]+)/<\1>/
	- 'the bigger they were, the bigger they will be' will work
	- 'the bigger they were, the faster they will be' won't work
	- /the (.*)er they (.*), the \1er we \2/
		- will match 'the faster they ran, the faster we ran'
		- won't match 'the faster they ran, the faster we ate'
	- these are capture groups

words:
 - utterance:
	- spoken correlate of a sentence
	- 'I do uh main- mainly business data processing'

 - fillers:
	- filles or filled pauses are words like 'uh' and 'uhm'

 - fragments:
	- broken off words like 'main-' in the above utterance

 - word types:
 	- 'They picnicked by the pool, then lay back on the grass and looked at the stars.'
	- number of DISTINCT words in a corpus
	- above utterance has 14 types

 - word tokens:
	- total number of words in a corpus
	- above utterance has 16 tokens

 - relationship between types V and tokens N:
	- |V| = kN^B
	- B depends on corpus size and genre, typically 0.67 to 0.75
	- k is a positive constant
	- eg. shakespear corpus has 884 thousand tokens (N) and 31 thousand types (|V|)
