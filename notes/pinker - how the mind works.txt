Pinker - How the Mind Works

robots:
 - we as humans undermine everything our brain can do
 - a robot 'sees' numbers and process them
 - difficult for a robot to process images (edge or shadow?)
	- say robots had a number for each pixel of light (bigger is lighter, small is dark)
 	- big numbers beside smaller numbers can mean different objects or just lighting

limbs:
 - a human's hands, feet, arms are miraculous
 - the precision and coordination between the brain and the limbs is very advanced
	- this would be extremely difficult for a robot to replicate

common sense:
 - our mind is also very good at categorizing objects and concepts
 - bachelor example:
	- what is a bachelor? a man who has never married 
	- what about a 17 year old boy who lives at home with parents
	- what about a 17 year old boy who left home at 13 to start a business
		- became successful and is now a playboy
	- what about a couple with a child who hasn't married?
		- wouldn you call the man in that relationship a bachelor?
 - humans have common sense, machines don't
 - a big thing we take for granted
	- eg. if you were alive at 9am and at 5pm, we assume you were alive at noon that day
	- robots don't implicitly know that
	- eg. if i left milk carton in car, we can say there is 1 gallon of milk in car
		- if i am sitting in car, is it fair to say there is 1 gallon of blood in car?
