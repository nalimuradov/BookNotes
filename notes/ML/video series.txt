MACHINE LEARNING

picking a good algorithm is as important as knowing the algorithms:
 - eg. can't give a carpenter tools but not teach them how to use them

supervised learning:
 - given correct data, predict a new point

classification:
 - answer is 0 or 1
 - eg. find if benign tumor or not

regression:
 - best fit line estimate, continuous
 - eg. find best price to sell house at

unsupervised learning:
 - find patterns in data and cluster into groups, no labels given
 - eg. google news stories
