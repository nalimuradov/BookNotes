three stages of imprisonment
 - admittance
 - day to day
 - liberation

Liberation
 - being freed immediately 
 - those freed are angry that their suffering was for nothing
 - they use their suffering as reason to make others suffer
 - he survived because he had something to look forward to, but it was a lie 

perspective
 - going to dachau instead of auchwitz
 - seeing convicts have somewhere to sleep as oppposed to themselves

when one has a why to live, they can deal with any how

you always have a choice

man who had dream that they will be free March 30th
 - hope let him live
 - disappointment then killed him


what is the meaning of life?
 - similar to asking a chess master: what is the best move in the world?
 - no such thing
 - its all unique to the person, place, situation, time

beautiful
 - "Live as if you were living for the second time and as if you acted the first time as
     wrongly as you are about to act now."

although the meaning changes, it can be discovered in one of three ways
 1) by creating a work or doing a deed
 2) love
 3) suffering
	- you cant change the suffering but you can change your attitude to the suffering

eg. mans wife dies
 - he suffers, but is confronted with the idea that: "what if he died first?" 
 - man is ready to suffer, if his suffering has meaning

key point: only necessary suffering works
 - unnecessary suffering is just masochism

logotherapy
 - primary human drive isn't pleasure, but the pursuit of meaning

everything can be taken from a man except one thing:
 - the ability to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances

mother who lost boy at 11yo
 - her other son was paralyzed and could barely move
 - she was overcome with grief and planned to commit suicide with her paralyzed son
 - but her paralyzed son stopped her
 - the paralyzed son found life meaningful, why didn't she?

man is not in pursue of happiness but rather in pursue of a reason to be happy

meaning of life is found in every moment of living

two types of men
 - indecent vs decent
 - there were decent nazi guards and indecent prisoners in the camp

on freedom, prisoners struggled with lack of responsiveness from the world
 - no one was waiting for them, life was going on regardless 
 - they felt all their suffering was for nothing

the hope that kept them alive was now gone
 - this is the most difficult thing
