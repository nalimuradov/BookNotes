selfishness vs selflessness:
 - are selfless actions actually selfless?
 - species dont do things for the good of the group

a selfless species cant exist:
 - if a selfish individual were to be introduced, he would over power
 - slowly will evolve to be selfish

our own species' importance:
 - a baby fetus has more privilege than an adult chimpanzee from our eyes
 - even though the chimp can feel and think
 - killing people outside of war is a serious crime, yet killing animals is a sport

the beginning:
 - survival of the stable
 - hydroden atoms to helium, bubbles being spherical, they are stable
 - stable mixtures in primeval soup was made, until the replicator came along

the replicator:
 - molecule that can create copies of itself
 - unlikely, but bound to happen

evolution:
 - nothing wants to evolve, evolution just happens
 - replicators sometimes make errors (which lead to evolution), but they dont want to error

genes:
 - we are the genes' hosts
 - they use us to propogate themselves

reproduction:
 - 46 chromosomes, 23 from each parent
 - genes from each parent determine your characteristics (eg. eye color)
	- if both blue, will have blue eyes
	- if one picked over the other, picked on is dominant and other is recessive
 - alleles within same chromosome can determine eye color
	- eg. a chromosome from one parent may have blue or brow

dna:
 - chain of nucleotides (A, C, T, G)
 - the difference in order is what separates mouse from octopus
 - two humans also have different orders (except twins)

mimicry:
 - some color butterflies taste nasty to birds
 - the ones that don't taste nasty but look similar cash in
 - the birds will think they taste nasty too and so this mimicry is passed down

immortality:
 - individuals are not stable things, neither are chromosomes
	- they are fleeting, shuffled into oblivion like a hand of cards soon after they are dealt
 - but the cards themselves survive the shuffling
	- the cards are the genes, they change patterns and march on
	- they can make copies that go forever, that is their defining property

natural selection luck:
 - genes that lose more than they win are not unlucky, they are bad
 - there are bound to be some good genes that are lost with the bad and vice versa, but variance fades out with enough data

fitting in with the rest of the body:
 - desirable attributes must fit with the rest of the body
 - eg. sharp teeth for meat eaters are very good
	- if a herbivore develops sharp teeth, it's worse for it 
	- not because sharp teeth aren't good, but because they are in a gene-pool dominated by genes for herbivorous qualities

why die at all then?:
 - well for example, some genes are lethal and can cause cancer
	- if the show up early in one's life, they can't reproduce therefore that lethal gene dies out
	- if the gene for cancer shows up late, the person has already reproduced and passed it on before it shows up
 - smart jeez

gene machines:
 - as the primordial soup began to dry up, the genes needed new sources of energy
 - plant-like organisms began obtaining energy directly from the sun
 - animal-like organisms began obtaining energy from plants or other animals
 - both have evolved massively to rule the skies, the waters, the ground, etc 

nerve control:
 - creatures have evolved ways to contract muscles when needed from the outside world
 - need to contract jaw only when biting, or need to run only when being chased, rather than just willy nilly
 - therefore, natural selection favored genes that were equipped with sense organs

genes and hosts:
 - the gene is to the person in the same way the person is to a program
 - eg. say we make a chess AI, we tell it good tactics and rules and then it's on its own
 - we are being controlled by genes in the same way
	- all the genes can do is set us up before hand and then passively watch, we are on our own
 - they cannot control us moment to moment because of time-lag problems
 	- it takes too long for it to be a conversation, it's more like letters being sent back and forth
 - rather than that, they make bodies with nervous systems who can handle split second decisions

 - genes must predict:
	- polar bear genes don't know ahead of time what enemies are lurking behind bush, etc
	- they safely predict though that their future is a cold one so they make a fur coat
		- because it is what they have always done and worked

 - prediction is gambling:
	- genes must make decisions and hope they off, so they maximize their likelihood of success
	- greatly cuts down time, but not all decisions are anticipated
	- genes predict sweet tastes or orgasms as 'good' as they likely lead to gene survival
		- overeating, sweeteners, are masturbation are not anticipated

simulation:
 - survival machines that can simulate the future are one jump ahead of survival machines who only learn through trial and error
 - trial and error is time consuming and often fatal, simulation is safer and faster
 - we are programs created by genes, and the world is the judge

communication:
 - a survival machine is said to have communicated with another one when it influences its behavior or state of nervous system
 - eg. bird singing, dog wagging tail, chimp grinning
 - could an animal lie then?
	- bird signals that 'hawks are coming' to other birds and is left with all the food to himself

lying:
 - it's not uncommon if it benefits the gene
 - eg. angler fish technically 'deceive' it's prey with the lure
 - fireflies have genus groups:
	- they typically mate within their group, not other
	- some females of one group may signal other group and then eat them when they arrive 
 - whenever communication evolves, there is always the danger of it's exploitation
 - will always occur when there is a conflict of interest
