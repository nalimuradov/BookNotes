chapter 1: basic probability
 - chance events:
	- 50/50 to get heads/tails
	- can manipulate (eg. weighted coin)
	- this creates a random variable
 
 - expectation of a rand var:
	- the number that attempts to capture center of the random variable's distribution
	- eg. expectation of 6-sided die is 3.5
	- E[X] = sig(xP(x))

 - variance:
 	- quantifies the spread of the random variable's distribution
	- Var(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2]

chapter 2: compound probability
 - set theory:
	- roll an even number: {2, 4, 6}
	- venn diagrams (AND, OR, NOT)
	- empty set, universal set

 - counting:
	- permutations: ordered sequencees
	- combinations: unordered sets
	- eg. draw marbles from a bag

 - conditional probability:
	- P(A|B)
	- probability it will rain today given it rained yesterday

chapter 3: probability distributions
 - random variables:
 	- a function that assigns a real number to each outcome in the probability space

 - discrete and continuous:
	- discrete random variable: finite number of possible values
	- continuous random variable: infinte number of possible values
