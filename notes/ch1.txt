PART 1 - MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS

some notation that I might forget:
 - B = (b1, b2, b3): ordered tuple
 - B = [b1, b2, b3]: matrix
 - B = {b1, b2, b3}: set
 - a, b, c, ...: scalaras
 - x, y, z, ...: vectors
 - <x, y>: inner product of x and y
 - rk(A): rank of matrix A
 - Im(x): image of linear mapping x
 - ker(x): kernel of linear mapping x
 - I: identity matrix
 - lambda: eigenvalue
 - E_lambda: eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue lambda
 - upside down triangle: gradient
 
three core concepts of ML:
 - data:
	- goal of ML is to extract valuable patterns from data
 - a model:
	- related to process that generates data, 
	- in regression, model would describe a func that maps inputs to real-valued outputs
	- model considered to be learning if performance improves on a given task after the data is factored in
 - learning:
	- a way to automatically find patterns and structure in data by optimizing the parameters of the model
