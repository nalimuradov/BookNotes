there are typically 3 types of ML algorithms:
 - supervised learning
 - unsupervised learning
 - reinforcement learning

supervised learning:
 - there is a target outcome variable (dependent variable)
	- to be predicted from given set of predictors (independent variables)
 - training continues until desired accuracy reached
 - examples: [regression, decision tree, random forest]

unsupervised learning:
 - there is not target outcome variable to predict
 - typically used for clustering population in different groups
 - examples: [k-means, apriori]

reinforcement learning:
 - machine is exposed to environment where it can train 'trial and error'
 - it learns from past experiences
 - examples: [markov decision process]

common ML algorithms:
 - linear regression
 - logistic regression
 - decision tree
 - SVM
 - naive bayes
 - kNN
 - k-means
 - random forest
 - dimensionality reduciton alg
 - gradient boosting algs:
	- GBM
	- XGBoost
	- LightGBM
	- CatBoost

--- ALGORITHMS ---

linear regression:
 - used to estimate real values based on continuous variables
 - the best fit line is the 'regression line'
	- represented by Y = aX + b
 - for example, say we ask a child to organize kids in classroom by weight, but he can't ask their weights
	- he will look at the height, build, etc which is correlated with weight 
 - Y: dependent variable
 - a: slop
 - X: independent variable
 - b: intercept
	- we get a and b by minimizing the sum of squared diff of distance between data points and regression line
 - two types of linear regression:
	- simple linear regression (one independent variable)
	- multiple linear regression (more than one independent variable)
