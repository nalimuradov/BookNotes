chapter 1: basic probability
 - chance events:
	- 50/50 to get heads/tails
	- can manipulate (eg. weighted coin)
	- this creates a random variable
 
 - expectation of a rand var:
	- the number that attempts to capture center of the random variable's distribution
	- eg. expectation of 6-sided die is 3.5
	- E[X] = sig(xP(x))

 - variance:
 	- quantifies the spread of the random variable's distribution
	- Var(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2]

chapter 2: compound probability
 - set theory:
	- roll an even number: {2, 4, 6}
	- venn diagrams (AND, OR, NOT)
	- empty set, universal set

 - counting:
	- permutations: ordered sequencees
	- combinations: unordered sets
	- eg. draw marbles from a bag

 - conditional probability:
	- P(A|B)
	- probability it will rain today given it rained yesterday

chapter 3: probability distributions
 - random variables:
 	- a function that assigns a real number to each outcome in the probability space

 - discrete and continuous:
	- discrete random variable: finite number of possible values
	- continuous random variable: infinte number of possible values
	- discrete distributions: bernoulli, binomial, geometric, poisson, negative binomial
	- continuous distributions: uniform, normal, exponential
	- cdf: curve goes up to 1
	- pmf: shows chance of each possibility

 - central limit theorem:
	- the sample mean of a sufficiently large number of i.i.d random variables is normally distributed

chapter 4: frequentist inference
 - point estimation:
	- estimator: a function of randomly sampled observations
	- can estimate pi by plotting dots on circle in a square
	- pi = 4*(S_circ/S_sqr)
	- let m be dots in circle and n be total dots
		- pi_estimator = 4*(m/n)

 - confidence interval:
	- estimate a parameter by specifying a range of possible values
	- confidence level: prob that the procedure used to generate interval will produce an interval containing the true parameter

 - bootstrap:
	- a way to estimate properties of an estimator via resampling
