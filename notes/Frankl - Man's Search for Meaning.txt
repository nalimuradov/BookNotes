Frankl - Man's Search for Meaning

hope:
 - "when one has a why to live, they can deal with any how"
 - there was a prisoner who had a dream that they will be freed March 30th
 - he survived against all odds due to the hope
 - when March 30th came around and nothing changed, the loss of hope killed him

happiness from perspective:
 - prisoners were ecstatic to go to dachau instead of auchwitz
 - seeing convicts have somewhere to sleep whereas the prisoners do not

"Man is not in pursue of happiness but rather in pursue of a reason to be happy"

"what is the meaning of life?":
 - similar to asking a chess master: what is the best move in the world?
 - no such thing
 - it's all unique to the person, place, situation, time

there are two types of men in the world:
 - indecent men and decent men
 - there were decent nazi guards and indecent prisoners in the camp
 - nazi guards who spared the prisoners bread 
 - prisoners who beat other prisoners and ratted others out

freedom:
 - when prisoners were freed, they struggled with the lack of responsiveness from the world
 - no one was waiting for them, life has been passing by
 - they felt all their suffering was for nothing
 - the hope that kept them alive in prison is now gone (this is the most difficult thing)

everything can be taken from a man except one thing:
 - the ability to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances
 - you always have a choice

mother who lost first boy at 11yo:
 - her other son was paralyzed and could barely move
 - she was overcome with grief and planned to commit suicide with her paralyzed son
 - but her paralyzed son stopped her
 - the paralyzed son found life meaningful, why didn't she?

"Live as if you were living for the second time and as if you acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now."
