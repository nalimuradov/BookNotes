1 - Intro to Human Behavioral Biology

stuff that goes on in body can influence what goes on in brain
 - reasons for murders: (junk food, period, steroid. tumor)

also, stuff that goes in brain can influence what goes on in body
 - stress

course focus:
 - intertwining between physiology and behavior

categorization:
 - our brain likes to categorize (pattern recognition)
 - see a line, guess it's a foot (same length as ruler)
 - easier for us to store in our brains:
	- rather than remembering every absolute detail
 - eg. say phone numbers without 3-3-4 pattern
	- way harder to remember
 - eg. 4th 14th 23rd 34th 
	- next number?
	- a new yorker will know it's 42nd
	- these are subway stops
