4 - Molecular Genetics

proteins:
 - structurally most important thing youve got
 - they form messengers, hold things together, etc
 - made of amino acids (20 different kinds)
	- different amino acids get pulled in different shapes by their attraction to water

enzymes:
 - catalyze reactions
 	- take two things and stick em together
	- take one thing and split it apart

central dogma of life:
 - flow of information DNA to RNA to protein
 - it all starts with DNA (most important)
 - DNA decides when information will flow to RNA to protein

possibilities of genetic mutation in DNA:
 - point mutation: one thing (nucleotide) changes into another thing
 - deletion mutation: accidentaly delete the letter
 - insertion mutation: accidentaly double the letter
