2 - Behavioral Evolution

when biologist sees male and female skull:
 - can tell many details such as..
 	- who is more likely to cheat
 	- what preferences they have

we can run many tests to predict giraffe heart size:
 - when we see the result, we are amazed that we are right
 - in reality, giraffes couldn't exist without hearts that size

darwin
 - didn't discover evolution
 - rather came up with the mechanism of evolution: natural selection

key points in darwinism
 - traits are heritable (can pass on traits)
 - there is variability in these traits (and all heritable)
 - some versions of those traits are better than others
 - its not about survival, its about reproduction
 - over time, the better versions become commonplace
