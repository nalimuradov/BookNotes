2.5 - Sorting Applications	

stability:
 - sort is stable if it preserves the relative order of equal keys in the array
 - eg. two equal values shouldn't change positions during the sort

algorithm 	stable?		inplace?	runtime		extra space	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
selection	no		yes		N^2		1
insertion	yes		yes		N to N^2	1
shellsort	no		yes		N^(6/5)		1
quicksort	no		yes		N*lgN		lgN
mergesort	yes		no		N*lgN		N
heapsort	no		yes		N*lgN		1

quicksort:
 - quicksort is the fastest general-purpose sort

mergesort:
 - if stability is important and space is available, mergesort might be best
