3.4 - Hash Tables

basic idea:
 - similar concept to arrays
 - reference key-value pairs using arrays by doing arithmetic ops to transform keys into array indices
 - consist of two separate parts:
	- compute hash function that transforms search key into array index
	- some keys may hash to same index, so must have collision resolution

hash functions:
 - if we have array that can hold M values:
	- must create hash that gives integer in range [0, M-1]
 - need a hash that is easy to compute and uniformly distributes keys
 - modular hashing:
	- common example
	- for any positive key k, compute the remainder when dividing k by M
	- easy to compute and will evenly distribute

good hash functions:
 - should be deterministive (equal keys must propduce same hash value)
 - should be efficient to compute
 - should uniformly distribute the keys

collision resolution:
 - if two keys hash to same index, can create linked list at that index

modular hashing example:
	key	hash (M=100)	hash (M=97)
 -------------------------------------------------------
	212	12		18
	618	18		36
	302	2		11
	940	40		67

hash tables:
 - finite size
 - do not allow null values
 - can be useful in cases where a normal array has values with large keys
	- hashing can make these keys smaller and more compact
