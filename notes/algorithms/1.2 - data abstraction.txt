1.2 - Data Abstraction

data types:
 - a set of values and a set of operations on those values

abstract data types:
 - a data type whose internal representation is hidden from the client

objects:
 - an entity that can  take on a data-type value
 - three properties:
	- state: (value from its data type)
	- identity: (distinguishes one object from another)
	- behaviour: (effect of data type operations)

API:
 - a list of constructors and instance methods with a description of each one		
 - eg. public class Counter
		    Counter(String id)		create a counter named id
	       void increment()			increment counter by one
	        int tally() 			number of increments since creation
	     String toString()			string representation
