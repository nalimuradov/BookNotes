1.5 - Union Find

union find:
 - we can specify connections between nodes
 - union(p,q) establishes a link between p and q
 - we can then check if two values are connected 
 - connected(p,q) returns true if p and q are connected

quick find:
 - give each value an id
 - two values are connected if their ids match
 - the id refers to the source node

quick union:
 - each node has a link to its parent
 - two nodes are connected if their root node is the same
 - parent node links to itself

weighted quick union:
 - similar to quick union
 - keep track of the size of each tree
 - always connect the smaller tree to the larger tree

weighted quick union with path compression:
 - we want every node to directly link to the root of its tree
 - but we do not want to pay price of changing large number of links
 - to fix, make all examine nodes directly link to root
