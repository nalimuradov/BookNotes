perceptron:
 - type of artificial neuron
 - take several binary inputs and output one binary output
 - eg. x1, x2, x3 can all be inputs, y can be output

 - each input can have weight w, to represent how important it is for output
 - output of this neuron will be 0 or 1, depending if it reaches a threshold value

 - cheese festival example:
	- factors: is weather good, does your girl wanna go, is it near a bus stop
	- each factor is an input: x1, x2, x3	
	- eg. if weather is good x1 = 1, if weather is bad x1 = 0
	- each one also has a weight based on how important it is to you	
	- if you really need the bus, the weight of x3 will be thicc
 	- say w1 = 2, w2 = 2, w3 = 3, threshold = 5
	- we can use this to see if threshold to go is met

 - we can have layers in a network, each one can make a decision at a more abstract/complex level
 - each perceptron has a single output:
	- the multiple output arrows in diagrams just demonstrate that the one output is used in multiple places
 
 - cleaner form: output = {0 if wx+b <= 0, 1 if wx+b > 0}
	- move threshold to other side and call it the bias
	- w and x are represented as vectors

 - bias:
	- a measure of how easy it is to get the perceptrion to fire
	- a perceptron with really big bias will be really easy to output 1
	- a perceptron with really negative bias will be really hard to output 1

 - logical functions:
	- we can use perceptrons to create functions like AND, OR, and NAND
	- eg. two inputs x1, x2, weights w1 = -2, w2 = -2, bias is 3
		- this is a NAND gate as inputs 00, 01, 10 all return 1, but 11 returns 0
	- we can use NAND gates to build anything and everything, like add two bits

 - inputs:
	- in diagrams, will be circled similarly to perceptrons
	- but they aren't actually perceptrons
	- a perceptron with no input will simply output 1 if b > 0, 0 if b <= 0
	
 - applications:
	- we can devise learning algorithms which can tune biases and weights of the network
	- tuning happens in response to external stimuli (no direct intervention from developer)
