perceptron:
 - type of artificial neuron
 - take several binary inputs and output one binary output
 - eg. x1, x2, x3 can all be inputs, y can be output

 - each input can have weight w, to represent how important it is for output
 - output of this neuron will be 0 or 1, depending if it reaches a threshold value

 - cheese festival example:
	- factors: is weather good, does your girl wanna go, is it near a bus stop
	- each factor is an input: x1, x2, x3	
	- eg. if weather is good x1 = 1, if weather is bad x1 = 0
	- each one also has a weight based on how important it is to you	
	- if you really need the bus, the weight of x3 will be thicc
 	- say w1 = 2, w2 = 2, w3 = 3, threshold = 5
	- we can use this to see if threshold to go is met

 - we can have layers in a network, each one can make a decision at a more abstract/complex level
 - each perceptron has a single output:
	- the multiple output arrows in diagrams just demonstrate that the one output is used in multiple places
