Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 1: Electric Properties of the Neuron

Lesson 1 - The Resting Potential

electricity:
 - the fundamental way by which neurons can communicate with eachother
 - the nervous system uses electricity for communication between cells

neuron at 'rest':
 - a neuron that is currently not involved in any active electrical signalling
 - resting neurons have unique properties, such as a voltage difference across their membrane called 'resting potential'
 	- deviations from this resting potential are how electrical signaling in neurons occurs

voltage:
 - the DIFFERENCE in electric potential between two points
 - similar to how there is gravitational potential energy for a ball at the top of a hill
	- energy is released as it starts to roll down

electrostatic force:
 - attraction/repulsion of ions (charged particles)
 - can be either positive or negative
 - opposites attract, likes repel
 - if we have two chared particles A, B (A is more positive, B is more negative):
	- a negative ion would move towards A
	- a positive ion would move towards B
	- ion will have 'potential' to move to A or B depending on its charge

cell membrane:
 - separate inside and outside of cell
 - ions cannot move across membrane without help of channels or pumps
 - outside of the cell is used as the 'ground'
	- eg. if inside of cell is 50 mV more negative than outside, we report the voltage as -50 mV

neurons:
 - neurons send signals using electricity
 - neurons themselves are electrically charged
 - the lipid membrane of neurons separates solutions of charged particles (such as K+ or NA+ ions)
 	- this separation creates a difference in potential energy across the membrane

 - in neurons that are not sending or receiving signals, the potential difference is called 'resting potential'

parts of neuron:
 - the soma is the body of the cell
	- houses the cell's nucleus
 - extending out of the cells body are:
	- axons (cylindrical chains)	
	- dendrites (the tree root looking things)
 - the outer surface of all these parts is made of lipid molecules 
	- this is the cell membrane

 - the membrane potential of a neuron at rest is about -70mV
	- measure difference between inside and outside of neuron
	- the outiside of the cell is GROUND
		- we need a '0' reference point

membrane potential:
 - describes the voltage across the membrane at any point in time

resting potential:
 - the membrane potential of a neuron that is "at rest"
	- when it is not sending or receiving signals

electrostatic and diffusive forces:
 - both inside and outside the neuron, ions exist in aqueous solution and are able to move around
 - two of the important forces that guide their behaviour are electrostatic and diffusive forces

diffusion:
 - the process by which particles spread out or mix in a solution
 - eg. dye diffusing in water over time until evenly distributed in the water
 - makes particles move from high to low concentration in the mixture

electrostatic force:
 - the forces by which similar charges repel and opposite charges attract
 - positive-positive and negative-negative repel
 - positive-negative and negative-positive attract

charges inside and outside of the membrane:
 - there is a soup of positive and negative charges all around
	- these charges are things like K+ or NA+ ions
 - however, the charge comes from an imbalance of positive/negative charges very close to the membrane
	- this generates an electric field which gives it electric potential
	- this arrangement is like a capacitor

channels:
 - allow movement of ions through the membrane
 - if we have more positive ions on inside, we need to move particles out to balance out
	- however only like 1/100000 particles need to move
	- this is because the electrostatic force is so much stronger than diffusion	
	- once one moves, the electrostatic force pushing back will overpower other particles
 - only a tiny proportion of ions move relative to the total ions inside and outside the cell

 - how many ions are on both sides doesn't really matter
	- it's the relative concentration gradient that determines equlibrium potential

sailor metaphor:
 - let anions be female sailors
 - let male british sailors represent potassium ions
 - let male american sailors represent sodium ions

 - there are approx same number of male and female sailors in both bars
 - however male sailors are mostly separated, mostly brits in one bar and americans in the other
 - because they want to establish presence in both bars while keeping ratio of genders
	- the male sailors move between two bars

 - if there are more brits/americans in one bar, some will move to the other bar
	- this is DIFFUSION

 - however, there is another force balancing the number of male and female sailors in a given bar
	- this is the ELECTROSTATIC FORCES
	- males move, while females stay put
	- a difference in gender ratios is like a voltage difference across the membrane
	- if either bar has excess of male or female sailors, it has a net charge
		- the greater the voltage, the more the sailors want to move to correct it

 - bouncer metaphor:
	- say there is a british bouncer that only lets brits through
	- will create an imbalance in nations across the bars
	- similar to how ions have different capabilities to cross the cell membrane through ion channels

equilibrium potential:
 - at some point, the diffusive and electrostatic forces acting on K+ ions will balance out
 - this is called the equilibrium potential

Nernst potential:
 - the potential at which the diffusion and electrostatic forces for an ion balance out
	- given particular concentrations inside and outside of the cell

 - E = (RT/zf) * ln(ion outside cell/ion inside cell)
	- E is the Nernst potential (aka  equilibrium potential)
		- subscript indicates which ion we're talking about
		- the reversal potential is when net flux of ions switches directions
 - R is the universal gas constant
 - T is temperature (kelvin)
 - z is the valence of the ion (the net charge of the ion and solution, eg potassium is +1)
 - F is the faraday constant
 - all multiplied by the log of the concentration of the ion outside of the cell over inside the cell
	- its the relative concentration that matters

 - for a neuron, the resting potential is close to the Nernst potential of potassium
	- however, the resting potential is composed of the flow of multiple ions
	- the nernst potential is just the passive equilibrium for a single ion

driving force:
 - a measure of how hard an ion is getting pushed across the membrane
 - it is the difference between membrane potential and nernst potential
	- E_drive = E_membrane - E_ion
 - we can think of ions as independently always wanting to approach their nernst potentials

 - average resting potential is -70mV
 - calcium has nernst potential of +123mV, while potassium has nernst potential of -80mV
 - the driving force for calcium is around -200mV, but it's only 10mV for potassium

 - calcium really wants to move down its concentration gradient and go inside the cell
	- it wants to approach equilibrium, which at rest is vastly different from membrane potential
	- thus, calcium ions rapidly rush in if given an opening

polarization:
 - depolarization is a positive change in the membrane potential (change to a more positive membrane potential)
 - hyperpolarization is a negative change in the membrane potential (change to a more negative membrane potential)

nernst potential scenario:
 - say we have 100 mM of K+ inside and 10 mM outside
 - diffusion will first push K+ out of the cell, which will lead to a buildup of positive charge outside the cell
 - electostatic force will push K+ back into the cell
 - nernst potential will be negative because a buildup of negative charge inside the cell was needed to balance the diffusion

 - the smaller the difference in concentration, the smaller the the nernst potential
