Fundamentals of Neuroscience

Part 1 - Electricty

electricity:
 - the fundamental way by which neurons can communicate with eachother
 - the nervous system uses electricity for communication between cells

neuron at 'rest':
 - a neuron that is currently not involved in any active electrical signalling
 - resting neurons have unique properties, such as a voltage difference across their membrane called 'resting potential'
 	- deviations from this resting potential are how electrical signaling in neurons occurs

voltage:
 - the DIFFERENCE in electric potential between two points
 - similar to how there is gravitational potential energy for a ball at the top of a hill
	- energy is released as it starts to roll down

electrostatic force:
 - attraction/repulsion of ions (charged particles)
 - can be either positive or negative
 - opposites attract, likes repel
 - if we have two chared particles A, B (A is more positive, B is more negative):
	- a negative ion would move towards A
	- a positive ion would move towards B
	- ion will have 'potential' to move to A or B depending on its charge

cell membrane:
 - separate inside and outside of cell
 - ions cannot move across membrane without help of channels or pumps
 - outside of the cell is used as the 'ground'
	- eg. if inside of cell is 50 mV more negative than outside, we report the voltage as -50 mV
