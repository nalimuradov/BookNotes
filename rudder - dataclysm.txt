Christian Rudder - Dataclysm

differences between what you want, what you say, and what you do:
 - aggregate data shows that men want women ages 20-23 (across all ages of men)
 - however when asked, they say they want someone near their age
 - however again, they mostly message women slightly younger than them (gap widens as older)

however for women:
 - they prefer men slightly older than them (at all ages)
 - as such, women have it harder in that the clock is ticking quick time for them
 - for every 100 men interested in a 20yo, there are only 9 interested in a 50yo
 
popularity of being polarizing:
 - john waters appears more in profiles than spielberg and george lucas combined
 - either you love it or hate it
 - repelling some people draws others closer 
 - being universally liked is to be relatively ignored
 - however being disliked by some is to be loved all the more by others
 
 - similarly, a women's attractiveness is enhanced when some men find her ugly
 - eg. rating from 1 to 5 -> avg will be 3 if all voted 3 or half voted 1 and other half voted 5
 - the second one has greater variance
 - the greater the variance the better
 - being polarizing will get you 70% more matches 
 - people not liking you brings you more attention on its own
 
 - biological logic:
	- a man seeing an unconvential women may think that other men are likely turned off
      	- as such, he assumes there is less comptetition, increasing his chance of success
      	- "i bet she doesn't meet many guys who think she's awesome, this is my diamond in the rough, etc...."
      	- on the other hand, broad appeal from an attractive woman will make you think there is more competition
      
 - pratfall effect:
      	- as long as you're generally competent, making a small, occasianal mistake makes people think you're more competent
      	- flaws call out the good stuff all the more
      	- smell of indole in perfumes and flowers, "a little bit of shit brings the bees"

 - you can see it in real life, for example models:
	- cindy crawford's career took off after she stopped covering her mole
	- linda evangelista had that hair
		- it didn't make her prettier necessarily, but it made her far more interesting
	
 - women who had blue hair, tats, unique clothes had far more messages:
	- far more people said No, but far more people also said Yes

writing and the internet:
 - in two years more words will be typed on twitter than written in very book in existence
 - naive assumption that things like twitter make us dumber (confined amount of writing)
 - rather, it makes us better at writing
	- makes us work with less, making us better

tracking writing patterns:
 - "poppin", "chillin", "nibba" (words with shortened endings, commonly used in same group)
 - "pelosi", "obamacare", "libs" (partisan talking points)
 - "bieber", "pleasee", "youu", "<33" (repeated last letter)

 - people who speak/type in similar ways will be drawn together

tracking words over time:
 - popularity of foods over time (tracked through text)
 - pasta dropped in 1990's due to Atkins died
 - red meat rose in popularity during world wars
 - ice cream became big in 1910's when powered home icebox introduced

message length over time:
 - since apple launched app store, okCupid message lengths dropped by over two thirds
 - more writing on phone led to shorter messages
 - the average message is now just over 100 characters
 - the highest response rate messages are between 40 to 60 characters long

copy-paste vs scratch-messaging strategy:
 - copy-paste underperforms by 25%
 - however in terms of effort-in to results-out, it beats out scratch-messaging
 - templates work

social graph analysis:
 - six degrees of separation applies for 99.6% of facebook users
 - the more mutual friends, the tighter the relationship

people don't know what they want until you show it to them:
 - like pinning the tail on the donkey with millions of people shouting advice
 - mostly they tell you indirectly, by not buying your product
 - however on websites, this is all tracked
	- we can see if a certain area isn't getting attention for whatever reason

love is blind:
 - okcupid had a day where profile pics were removed (which led to an app that failed)
 - many people didn't use because they insisted they see the other person
 - however, dates that took place weren't affected by how either looked
	- data showed that attractiveness was nearly irrelevant
 - people appear to be preselecting online for something that doesn't seem important once they sit down

racism:
 - racism is not for the outliers, it is pervasive
 - black women are rated the lowest by all races of men on okcupid, including black men
 - when asked, people obviously reply they wouldn't want to date someone who has negative bias towards certain race
 - this data is us, it is a reflection of what we are
	- that's why people don't like linking facebook or social media to dating sites
	- if your friends see what you do, you cannot express how you truly feel in fear of judgment
 - "but i have black friends"
	- how you treat your friends, is by definition, the exception to how you treat the rest of humanity
	- obama mentioned how people will clutch purse tighter or lock cars when black person walks by
 - these stats are consistent acorss all sites
 - women on the other hand judge men of their own race the highest, with white a close second for each race
 - profiles that put 'asian + white' had higher success than profiles with just 'asian'

 - these flashes intuition don't just pertain to love:
	- this decides who you rent your apartment to
	- who will get an interview
	- eg. Emily and Greg vs Lakisha and Jamal study 
		- same resume with different names
		- Emily and Greg got 50% more responses

 - most of us acknowledge that racism is wrong:
	- however, it is implicit in the decisions we make

 - osagie k obasogie study:
	- interviewed people blind from birth
	- found same attitudes about race as in the sighted word

 - around the world, the culturual norms shift:
	- blonde in asia is like what

attractivess:
 - on dating sites, effect of attractiveness is exponential (like richter scale)
 - while a 10th percentile barely different from 20th percentile
	- going from 90th to 100th is massive jump
 - women get even more messages 
 - doesn't only apply to dating
	- shiftgig gives more interviews to higher rated women
	- have more facebook friends
 - success and beauty are correlated for both sexes, but steeper for women
	- every percentile of attractiveness gives a man two new facebook friends
	- gives a women three
	- women are treated as if its okcupid, even at a job application

 - your appearance and profile picture affects you more than you know:
 	- when okcupid made pics higher res, increased matches of attractive ppl by 80%

figuring out what a person thinks:
 - hardest part, as what you to uncover most is what your subjects are most eager to hide
 - things related to race, sexual behaviours, drug use, etc
 - respondents answer questions in ways that make them look good
	- this is called 'social desirability bias'
 - bradley effect:
	- pollers in california election said they voted for Tom Bradley (black candidate) when asked, by a significant margin
 	- however, his white opponent won a narrow victory
 - other problems like addiction and racism are extremely difficult to uncover:
	- people cannot be honest about them

 - google trends help:
	- people search what they truly want to ask or how they feel
	- n-word is more american than the word 'apple pie', by 30%
	- usage of n-word rose extremely during obamas campaign and election	
	- was also very common during trayvon martin george zimmerman case
 
 - google auto complete:
	- when you begin typing a phrase, it will autocomplete with the most popular searches
	- this can give you a peek into what people search for and think
	- why is tongue white, why is my urine cloudy
	- our hidden thoughts are becoming part of the world

 - this data ends arguments that anecdotal evidence could never win

herd mentality:
 - "earth is now 2014 years old"
 - justine socco tweet
 - people were ready to kill her and her family
 - rumors spread that her father was a billionaire so its fine
 - anonimity of the internet brings out the darkest
