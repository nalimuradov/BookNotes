Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 2: Neurons and Networks

Lesson 5 - Neuronal Plasticity

neuronal plasticity:
 - the nervous system's ability to adapt and change when faced with a changing environment
 - your brain is changing to read these lines, it is shaped by experience
 - brain can experience neuronal plasticity at many levels
	- from a single synapse, to the whole network
 - up until now we've only considered the case where the brain is constant, like the wiring in our house

 - the point of plasticity is to allow us to adapt faster than what evolution allows
	- for instance in response to an injury or smth
