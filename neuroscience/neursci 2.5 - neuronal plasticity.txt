Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 2: Neurons and Networks

Lesson 5 - Neuronal Plasticity

neuronal plasticity:
 - the nervous system's ability to adapt and change when faced with a changing environment
 - your brain is changing to read these lines, it is shaped by experience
 - brain can experience neuronal plasticity at many levels
	- from a single synapse, to the whole network
 - up until now we've only considered the case where the brain is constant, like the wiring in our house

 - the point of plasticity is to allow us to adapt faster than what evolution allows
	- for instance in response to an injury or smth

 - typically categorized based on the timescale on which they act
	- short-term plasticity acts on a timescale of milliseconds to minutes
	- long-term plasticity acts on a timescale of minutes to hours or more

short-term plasticity:
 - synaptic enhancement is the short-term strengthening of synaptic connections
	- results from an increased probabiluty of pre-synaptic neurons releasing neurotransmitter in response to action potentials
 - synaptic facilitation:
	- the short-term strengthing of synapses (recorded as an increased excitatory post-synaptic potential)
 - synaptic depression:
	- the short-term weakening of synapses (attributed to depletion of readily releasable neurotransmitter)

long-term plasticity:
 - while short-term plasticity is crucial in quick adaptation, it doesn't explain the changes in our brain when we learn to ride a bike
 - in order to do this, we need mechanisms that can alter synapses in a stable way that lasts a long time:
	- two well-described phenomena for achieving this are LTP (long-term potentiation) and LTD (long-term depression)
 - LTP makes synapses stronger, and LTD makes synapses weaker

hebb's rule:
 - how does the brain choose to make synapses weaker or stronger?
 - "cells that fire together, wire together", "neurons out of sync, lose their link"
	- eg. if neurons A and B send axons to neuron C, we can stimulate A and C synchronously at high frequency to strengthen synapse between A and C

 - pavlov's dog is a good example:
	- can teach dog to salivate at sound of bell
	- while initially the connection between auditory neurons and salivatory neurons are weak
		- pairing the bell with stimuli that evokes salivation gradually potentiates the sound-to-salivation synapse
		- there isn't a singular sound-to-salivation synapse, rather this is a simplified example

long-term potentiation:
 - a well studied type of LTP is NMDA-dependent LTP

 - to make a synapse stronger, we must either:
	- make more neurotransmitter be released
	- increase number of receptors on the postsynaptic side
	- somehow make postsynapic receptors produce a larger effect

 - two types of LTP: Hebbian and non-Hebbian
	- hebbian LTP follows that "cells that fire together wire together" paradigm
		- most common type of LTP
	- non-hebbian LTP works in the opposite of direction of hebbian
		- when pre and postsynaptic neurons fire together, the synapses tend to weaken


NMDA receptor-dependent LTP:
 - in hebbian LTP, a synapse is strengthened when the pre and post synaptic partners fire in close temporal proximity
	- what fires together wires together
	- however, how does nature implement such a rule?
		- one answer is the NMDA receptor

 - the NMDA receptor is ionotropic, which means when it opens it let's cations (calcium) through it
	- hard to open, needs 2 ligands to open it
	- NMDA receptor is both ligand-gated and voltage-gated

 - NMDA receptors carefully allow calcium to pass through when both pre and post-synaptic sides of a given synapse are active

long-term depression:
 - a mechanism to make synapses weaker
 - if synapses were only reinforced in the positive direction, all synapses would eventually be saturated at max without being able to be decreased
 - typically induced by a long period of weak simulation of the presynaptic neuron that's uncorrelated with post-synaptic firing
	- "out of sync, lose their link"
 - not all LTD is heddian
 - the removal of receptor molecules from the postsynaptic membrane renders them less able to react to neurotransmitters that are being released

spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP):
 - fire together wires together, out of sync lose link still applies, but we need to be more precise
 - the strength and occurence of long-term plasticity depends on the precise delay between pre and post-synaptic spikes at a millisecond time scale

 - presynaptic spikes arriving just before the postsynaptic spike results in potentiation of synapse
 - presynaptic spikes arriving just after the postsynaptic spike results in depression of synapse

 - why would nature have evolved such a system?
	- to reinforce causal firing
	- if a presynaptic neuron fires before postsynaptic one, then the spike could have plausibly caused the postsynaptic neuron to fire
	- in the reverse it works the same, where it would be impossible for the presynaptic spike to have influenced the postsynaptic one becuase it came after

nonsynaptic plasticity:
 - occurs in the axon, dendrites, or some other nueorn
 - involves modification of ion channel function at these sites

 - strives to keep the excitability of a neuron in some desirable operating range
	- if a cell fires too much, it runs the risk of damaging itself or the network
	- if a cell fires too little, it's wasting resources
