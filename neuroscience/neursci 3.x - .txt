Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 3: The Brain

Lesson x - Subcortical Brain Areas

hindbrain:
 - aka rhombencepha;pm
 - lowest part of the brain, contiguous with the spinal cord (at the bottom of the brain in humans)

 - controls functions like heart rate, respiration, and swallowing
	- this is the core of life
	- in many animals it is their brain's only function

 - the hindbrain refers to the medulla, the pons, and the cerebellum
	- medulla and pons are part of the brainstem

 - most injuries to the brain stem result in instant death

midbrain:
 - associated with vision, hearing, motor control, arousal, alertness
 - the tectum is the top part of the mid brain and controls auditory and visual reflexes
 - more involved in voluntary body movenet, rather than basic reflexes of the hindbrain

brain stem -> limbic system -> cortex

brain stem:
 - basic life support, extends from the spinal cord
 - we are not aware of most of waht the brain is doing
	
limbic system:
 - core valuations
 - we are not actively aware of feelings on our skin, but when a bug lands on your arm you instantly know
 - amygdala controls fear and aggression

cortex:
 - thinking brain

cerebellum:
 - seperate structure at the bottom of the brain
