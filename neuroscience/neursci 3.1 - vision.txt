Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 3: The Brain

Lesson 1 - Vision

vision system:
 - arguable one of the most important senses
 - the human vision system is remarkable, allowing us to detect specs of dust on our fingers
 - half of our brain is devoted (in one way or another) to processing visual information and making sense of it

 - the vision system is the part of the CNS that gives organisms ability to detect/process/interprep info from visible light
 - first we must deal with the reception of light on the retina
	- information is then transfered along the optic nerve into a relay station deep within the brain to the thalamus
	- in the thalamus, the inputs are sorted and begun to be processed
	- from there, the information goes to the visual cortex

visual cortex:
 - the visual cortex extracts all sorts of info from the visual scene, such as shape, color, distance, motion, etc
 - the information flow in cortex is both sequential and parallel

light:
 - it is a kind of electromagnetic radiation that lies on a spectrum which includes radio waves, microwaves, x-rays
 - visible light is between infrared and ultraviolet
	- 390 to 700 nm
	- radio -> microwave -> infrared -> visible -> ultraviolet -> x-ray -> gamma ray
	- the more right, the smaller the wavelength

 - while light is a wavelength, it also behaves like a discrete particle
	- we call these particles, photons
	- there is a minimum unit of light which is the photon

 - the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency and inversely proportional to its wavelength
	- as such, a blue photon has more energy than a red photon

eye:
 - like a camera, the cornea and lens are the lenses that focus light
 - light is collected through the lens, which changes its shape to focus the light by the action of specialized muscles
	- these muscles are called cilliary muscles
 - photoreceptors are the light sensitive cells which record the light
 - the retina then processes the image and transmits it down to the optic nerve

 - eyes can also adjust to differences in illumination through pupil dilation
 - the human eye has 100 million photo receptors, but most of the are near the center at the fovea

phototransduction:
 - the retina has specialized in such a way such that it can carry out two distinct functions
 	- these are embodied in two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones
 	- these are the biological equivalent to pixels
		- rods have allowed us to detect low light levels (dusk and dawn) (much more rods than cones in the human retina)
		- cones allow us to detect higher light levels (between sunrise and sunset)

 - phototransduction is the process of conversion of electromagnetic to chemical to electrical energy in a sequential cascade
	- as photons land on the eye and fall onto retina, they're absorbed by photo receptor cells in the outer segment

color vision:
 - cones are responsible for color vision and eye color sensitivity
 - three types of cones: S, M, L
	- each detects different wavelengths (short, medium, long)	
	- these three cones sense red, blue, and green light
	- as such, we have adapted to see other colors through combinations of these three types of cones (thrichomat)

metamers:
 - different patterns that elicit the same percept
 - a picture of a flower on a computer may look similar to a real one but it's not
	- if we zoom in, we'll see a combination of tiny RGB spots, which are tailored to excite your cone types

 - other animals like fish and birds have four cones so they can distringuish colours that would look the same to us
 - some people may have only two cones, causing color-blindness (can't tell red from green)

retinal processing:
 - the action potential change in the retina when exposed to light has been extensively studied

 - the retina is organized in 3 main specialized cellular layers:
	- outer layer contains the photoreceptors, rods, and cones
	- inner nuclear layer contains interneurons
	- ganglion layer contains retinal ganglion cells (which are the output neurons which are transmitted to the brain)
		- these are the only cells in the retina capable of generating action potentials
	- each layer is connected through synaptic layers

receptive field:
 - the region of visual space that when stimulated evokes a response in the cell

retinal circuit:
 - the direct pathway is the flow of info from the inputphotorceptor cell -> bipolar cell -> output retinal ganglion cell
 - photoreceptors are depolarized in the dark and hyperpolarized in light
	- when there is no light, photoreceptors are active and release glutamate
	- conversely, they're inhibited and stop releasing glutamate in the presence of light

retinofugal projection:
 - where does visual information go once it leaves retina?
	- the axons leaving the retina go a whole host of different places
 - the neural pathways that leave the eye, beginning with optic nerve, is called the retinofugal pathway

 - the retinofugal projection has five major parts before reaching the visual cortex:
	- the optic nerve: a bundle of nerve fibers leaving each retina
	- the optic chiasma: where nerves from both eyes combine
	- the optic tract
	- the lateral geniculate nucleus
	- the optic radiation

primary visual cortex (V1):
 - the cortex (which means 'bark' in lating) is the folded layer of tissue that covers the cerebrum
	- like a crumpled piece of paper overlying the rest of the brain
 	- composed of six layers (imagine six pieces of paper on top of each other)

 - the primary visual cortex is located at the back of the brain
	- the primary visual cortex also goes by the name V1

visual pathways:
 - once the visual information reaches the back of your brain, it is processed in two pathways: ventral and dorsal

 - ventral pathway is called the 'what pathway' and it identifies objects
	- information flows from V1 to V2 to V4 to IT

 - lesions in V1 or V2 cause scotoma (localised blind spots)
 - lesions in IT have more complicated effects (agnosia) (problems with object recognition)

 - dorsal pathway is called the 'where or how pathway' and it identifies where objects are in space and how we may interact with them
	- MT detects direction of motion, and PPA is responsible for spatial attention

 - lesions in MT result in akinetopsia (inability to detect motion)
	- affected patients see the world as snapshots
 - lesions in PPA causes visual neglect (where patient does not perceive part of the world)

the binding problem:
 - how can we combine color, movement, etc into one motion
 - this is the next step of research, as most of this is unknown
