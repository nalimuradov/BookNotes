Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 1: Electric Properties of the Neuron

Lesson 3 - The Action Potential

action potential:
 - neuron communication done through rapid changes in the membrane potentials
 - these fast changes are called action potentials
	- can be sent down an axon in order to send an electrical signal from one neuron to the next
 - another word for an action potential is a 'spike'
	- because of shape that we see in voltage trace for a neuron when action potential occurs

	- these are actually 'compound' action potentials, because many spikes are firing at once (but it's basically the same idea)
 - the passive properties discussed previously are not enough to send signals

ion concentrations:
 - in a typical neuron there is more K+ inside the cell
 	- and there is more Cl- and Na+ outside the cell

voltage-gated channels:
 - open or close depending on local membrane potential
	- variable conductances depending on the potential
 - these are like floodgates, and can allow ions to pour through
 	- easy flow sometimes, and restricted flow other times
 - there are voltage gated sodium and potassium channels

voltage-gated sodium channels:
 - open and close very quickly
 - inactivation (ball-and-chain thing) is slow however
	- inactivation state is different from the closed state!
	- inactivation is the ball-chain, in the closed state the pore itself is actualyl closed
	- channel can be both open and inactivated
 - most likely to be open when membrane potential is more positive
 	- therefore usually closed when cell is at resting potential 
 - if voltage nudged up, they start to open
 - potential changes quickly to positive values
 - however then, the sodium channels simply turn off (become inactivated)
	- this happens soon after it's opened
	- stops the pour of sodium ions

voltage-gated potassium channels:
 - we need to send lots of signals through sodium channels, so we need to somehow quickly reset the membrane
 	- this is where the potassium channels come in
 - also open in response to positive membrane potentials
 - however, they are a bit slower than the sodium channels

phases of action potential:
 - start at resting potential
 - then some stimulus raises the membrane potential, until threshold reached
 - then there is the rising phase, a rapid depolarization of the membrane
	- this is driven by voltage-gated sodium channels (sodium begins to pour into the cell)
 - then comes the falling phase
	- this is caused by the sodium channels closing and the potassium channels opening
 - this is followed by an undershoot of hyperpolarization, where the membrane potential is more negative than it was at rest
 - end with the recovery, where we slowly return to resting potential as the potassium channels close

 - entire process only spans a few milliseconds

channels and probability:
 - when we say these channels are 'voltage-gated', we mean that the probability of the channels being open/closed is a function of voltage
 - sodium channel is more stable (more happy) in the open state when the voltage is higher
	- however, in can still be closed when the voltage is high (and vice versa), it's just less likely
	- in the large scale though, they give rise to a continuous shape
 - nothing is ever 100% in biology

channel kinetics:
 - how come both vg-sodium and vg-potassium channels don't just open at once and cancel each other out? kinetics
 - kinetics is the probabilistic temporal dynamics of a molecular reaction (or movement) going from one state to the other
 	- channels with fast kinetics are able to move rapidly back and forth between states (eg. open and closed states)

 - the kinetics of the channels and probability of channels opening/closing changes the ion permeability at different times
	- if sodium and potassium channels had same kinetics, there would be no action potential
	- sodium and potassium ions would largely cancel eachother out

refractory period:
 - a period of time where we can't easily stimulate another action potential
 - two kinds of refractory periods:
	- absolute:
		- driven by inactivation kinetics of vg-sodium channels
		- while in inactive state, we can't initiate another activation potential no matter how hard we try
	- relative
		- occurs at tail end of action potential
		- caused by vg-sodium channels inactivating
		- vg-sodium channels are active again but vg-potassium channels are yet to open
		- with a big enough stimulus, we can drive another action potential to start
			- however, takes a bigger input since cell is starting below resting potential

neurotoxins:
 - tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a natural toxin that blocks the vg-sodium channels
	- found in pufferfish (residue of the toxin is why people feel numbness in lips when they eat it)
 - TTX is very useful in neuroscience
	- application of TTX to a neuron will prevent an action potential from initiating

artificially lowering resting potential:
 - if lowered resting potential by 10mV, then we'd need a larger injected current to stimulate an action potential
 - this is because with a hyperpolarized resting potential, more current is needed to bring the membrane to the action potential threshold
