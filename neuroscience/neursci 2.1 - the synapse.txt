Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 2: Neurons and Networks

Lesson 1 - The Synapse

synapse:
 - so far we've examined one neuron, but how would two neurons communicate?
 - synapses are junctions between neurons
 - a structure that allows information to pass from one neuron to another
 - the main function of neurons is to talk to each other
	- this communication occurs at sites called synapses

polarized:
 - majority of neurons are polarized cells
 - means that one portion of cell is for receiving input, and other is for sending output
	- soma/dendrite side receives input
	- axon/synapses
 - **note that this is unrelated to the polarized membranes from last section
	- polarized here refers to two ends having different characteristics

dendrites:
 - parts of cell that are specialied for receiving inputs
 - signal received by dendrite is passed to the cell body
 - if there is sufficient depolarization, an action potential is sent down the axon

 - while the typical neuron has three parts (body, dendrites, axon), there are exceptions
	- some neurons have no acons, such as granule cells in olfactory bulb
		- they send signals through their dendrites

synapse:
 - the interface between the axon of one neuron and the dendrite of another neuron
 - typically two types of synapses:
	- electric synapses
	- chemical synapses

elctrical synapses:
 - less common in our nervous system
 - they are like "pores" between two cells that allow ions to pass through
	- allow passage without much fuss
	- like combining two cells into a larger cell
 - these are faster and allow cells to couple together

 - these synapses are often used in escape reflexes that require very fast conduction in a multi-neuron circuit

 - electrical synapses also allow bi-directional signalling
	- cell A can cause cell B to fire
	- cell B can cause cell A to fire
	- this is useful when syncrhony is desired
	- the heart relies on this to beat in unison

chemical synapses:
 - here instead the action potential travels to the end of an axon which causes a chemical to be released
	- released in a small space between the two neurons called the 'synaptic cleft'
	- the molecules must traverse the synaptic cleft through diffusion
 - chemical synapses are uni-directional

 - in this case, the two cells are separate entities
	- an action potential in one cell doesn't directly spread to the other cell
 
 - how it works:
	- a chemical signal is released by the presynaptic cell
	- it is received by the postsynaptic cell
	- only after it is received can it possible cause the postsynaptic neuron to fire
	- as such, it is much slower than electrical synapses

 - then why are chemical synapses much more common?
	- diversity
	- electrical synapses can only use voltage to transmit information
	- eg. some chemical signals tell postsynaptic neuron to increase or decrease the likelihood of firing
		- these chemicals are called 'neurotransmitters'
		- neurotransmitters transmit signals across a chemical synapse 

	- another advantage is that it decouples the arrival of an incoming action potential
		- from the generation of an action potential in the downstream neuron

 - neuromodulators:
	- chemicals like serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine
	- they modulate the activity of neurons

anatomy of a synapse:
 - when we refer to synapse, we mean chemical synapse (at least for this course)
 
 - presynaptic terminal:
	- notice how the axon is a little thicker close to the synaptic cleft, that is the presynaptic terminal
	- contains much more of the specialized molecular machinery

 - vesicles:
	- small hollow spheres that are made out of same material as cell membrane
	- they hold the small quantity of signaling molecules at the ready in the presynaptic terminal
	- arriving action potential causes vesicles to fuse to the membrane and became part of it, releasing payload into cleft
	- these molecules then diffuse and bind to 'receptors' on the other side of the cleft

 - receptors:
	- must bind to a very specific molecule which will affect some change in the postsynaptic neuron when they bind
	- like a little machine that can only be turned on by a particular key
	- there are many kinds of receptors which can exert different kinds of influences on the downstream cell

 - ionotropic receptors:
	- these are receptors that are ion channels
	- when they bind their neurotransmitter of interest, the channel opens
	- eg. a channel that lets cations into the cell can depolarize the cell
