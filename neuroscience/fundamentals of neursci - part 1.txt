Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 1: Electric Properties of the Neuron

Lesson 1 - The Resting Potential

electricity:
 - the fundamental way by which neurons can communicate with eachother
 - the nervous system uses electricity for communication between cells

neuron at 'rest':
 - a neuron that is currently not involved in any active electrical signalling
 - resting neurons have unique properties, such as a voltage difference across their membrane called 'resting potential'
 	- deviations from this resting potential are how electrical signaling in neurons occurs

voltage:
 - the DIFFERENCE in electric potential between two points
 - similar to how there is gravitational potential energy for a ball at the top of a hill
	- energy is released as it starts to roll down

electrostatic force:
 - attraction/repulsion of ions (charged particles)
 - can be either positive or negative
 - opposites attract, likes repel
 - if we have two chared particles A, B (A is more positive, B is more negative):
	- a negative ion would move towards A
	- a positive ion would move towards B
	- ion will have 'potential' to move to A or B depending on its charge

cell membrane:
 - separate inside and outside of cell
 - ions cannot move across membrane without help of channels or pumps
 - outside of the cell is used as the 'ground'
	- eg. if inside of cell is 50 mV more negative than outside, we report the voltage as -50 mV

neurons:
 - neurons send signals using electricity
 - neurons themselves are electrically charged
 - the lipid membrane of neurons separates solutions of charged particles (such as K+ or NA+ ions)
 	- this separation creates a difference in potential energy across the membrane

 - in neurons that are not sending or receiving signals, the potential difference is called 'resting potential'

parts of neuron:
 - the soma is the body of the cell
	- houses the cell's nucleus
 - extending out of the cells body are:
	- axons (cylindrical chains)	
	- dendrites (the tree root looking things)
 - the outer surface of all these parts is made of lipid molecules 
	- this is the cell membrane

 - the membrane potential of a neuron at rest is about -70mV
	- measure difference between inside and outside of neuron
	- the outiside of the cell is GROUND
		- we need a '0' reference point

membrane potential:
 - describes the voltage across the membrane at any point in time

resting potential:
 - the membrane potential of a neuron that is "at rest"
	- when it is not sending or receiving signals

electrostatic and diffusive forces:
 - both inside and outside the neuron, ions exist in aqueous solution and are able to move around
 - two of the important forces that guide their behaviour are electrostatic and diffusive forces

diffusion:
 - the process by which particles spread out or mix in a solution
 - eg. dye diffusing in water over time until evenly distributed in the water
 - makes particles move from high to low concentration in the mixture

electrostatic force:
 - the forces by which similar charges repel and opposite charges attract
 - positive-positive and negative-negative repel
 - positive-negative and negative-positive attract

charges inside and outside of the membrane:
 - there is a soup of positive and negative charges all around
	- these charges are things like K+ or NA+ ions
 - however, the charge comes from an imbalance of positive/negative charges very close to the membrane
	- this generates an electric field which gives it electric potential
	- this arrangement is like a capacitor

channels:
 - allow movement of ions through the membrane
 - if we have more positive ions on inside, we need to move particles out to balance out
	- however only like 1/100000 particles need to move
	- this is because the electrostatic force is so much stronger than diffusion	
	- once one moves, the electrostatic force pushing back will overpower other particles
 - only a tiny proportion of ions move relative to the total ions inside and outside the cell

 - how many ions are on both sides doesn't really matter
	- it's the relative concentration gradient that determines equlibrium potential

sailor metaphor:
 - let anions be female sailors
 - let male british sailors represent potassium ions
 - let male american sailors represent sodium ions

 - there are approx same number of male and female sailors in both bars
 - however male sailors are mostly separated, mostly brits in one bar and americans in the other
 - because they want to establish presence in both bars while keeping ratio of genders
	- the male sailors move between two bars

 - if there are more brits/americans in one bar, some will move to the other bar
	- this is DIFFUSION

 - however, there is another force balancing the number of male and female sailors in a given bar
	- this is the ELECTROSTATIC FORCES
	- males move, while females stay put
	- a difference in gender ratios is like a voltage difference across the membrane
	- if either bar has excess of male or female sailors, it has a net charge
		- the greater the voltage, the more the sailors want to move to correct it

 - bouncer metaphor:
	- say there is a british bouncer that only lets brits through
	- will create an imbalance in nations across the bars
	- similar to how ions have different capabilities to cross the cell membrane through ion channels

equilibrium potential:
 - at some point, the diffusive and electrostatic forces acting on K+ ions will balance out
 - this is called the equilibrium potential

Nernst potential:
 - the potential at which the diffusion and electrostatic forces for an ion balance out
	- given particular concentrations inside and outside of the cell

 - E = (RT/zf) * ln(ion outside cell/ion inside cell)
	- E is the Nernst potential (aka  equilibrium potential)
		- subscript indicates which ion we're talking about
		- the reversal potential is when net flux of ions switches directions
 - R is the universal gas constant
 - T is temperature (kelvin)
 - z is the valence of the ion (the net charge of the ion and solution, eg potassium is +1)
 - F is the faraday constant
 - all multiplied by the log of the concentration of the ion outside of the cell over inside the cell
	- its the relative concentration that matters

 - for a neuron, the resting potential is close to the Nernst potential of potassium
	- however, the resting potential is composed of the flow of multiple ions
	- the nernst potential is just the passive equilibrium for a single ion

driving force:
 - a measure of how hard an ion is getting pushed across the membrane
 - the farther away it is from the membrane potential, the greater the force
 - it is the difference between membrane potential and nernst potential
	- E_drive = E_membrane - E_ion
 - we can think of ions as independently always wanting to approach their nernst potentials

 - average resting potential is -70mV
 - calcium has nernst potential of +123mV, while potassium has nernst potential of -80mV
 - the driving force for calcium is around -200mV, but it's only 10mV for potassium

 - calcium really wants to move down its concentration gradient and go inside the cell
	- it wants to approach equilibrium, which at rest is vastly different from membrane potential
	- thus, calcium ions rapidly rush in if given an opening

polarization:
 - depolarization is a positive change in the membrane potential (change to a more positive membrane potential)
 - hyperpolarization is a negative change in the membrane potential (change to a more negative membrane potential)

nernst potential scenario:
 - say we have 100 mM of K+ inside and 10 mM outside
 - diffusion will first push K+ out of the cell, which will lead to a buildup of positive charge outside the cell
 - electostatic force will push K+ back into the cell
 - nernst potential will be negative because a buildup of negative charge inside the cell was needed to balance the diffusion

 - the smaller the difference in concentration, the smaller the the nernst potential

 - key point: IONS WILL FLOW IN WHATEVER DIRECTION BRINGS THE MEMBRANE POTENTIAL CLOSER TO NERNST POTENTIAL

GHK equation:
 - calculates the resting potential for a cell
 - there are many ions flowing through which counterbalance eachother

 - equilibrium vs steady state:
	- equilibrium for an ion (nernst) is when flow of ion in is same as flow of ion out (no net flow in either direction)
 	- steady state is when all charges in and out of cell will be equal and opposite
		- since no particular ion is at equilibrium, we call this steady state instead
		- eg. resting potential is a steady state
		- the concentrations are stable even if there is quite a bit of movement behind the scenes

 - reduces down to the nernst equation when we restrict movement across the membrane to a single ion

 - the two most important factors in determine the resting potential of a neuron are:
	- concentrations of ions inside and outside the membrane
	- the permeability of these ions

 - E = RT/F * ln(sum of perm_e*concentrations / sum of perm_i*concentrations)

 - say we have K+, how might a cell achieve a more negative resting potential?
	- lowering extracellular K+ or increasing extracellular K+
	- we can see this with the equation

permeability:
 - how much can flow through membrane
 - say sodium has positive nernst and wants to flow through
	- it can't just rush in because there are very few open sodium channels in a resting membrane
	- thus, we say sodium has a low permeability

 - if neurons with low permeability were to get higher permeability, there would be much bigger change
	- because of how big the driving force is typically for those ions with low permeability

 - rather than adjusting concentrations, what neurons do instead is to adjust permeability
	- this is much easier, and this is how neurons communicate! 

threshold voltage:
 - around -55 mV
 - this is the voltage where a neuron fires an 'action potential' to communicate with other neurons
	- if this threshold isn't reached, the neuron stays inactive

size of neuron:
 - larger neurons spend more energy at rest
 - the larger surface area means there are more channels that can dissipate resting potential
 - more sodium-potassium pumps are needed to maintain it

ion filters:
 - how does something allow K+ to pass but not Na+?
 - both are positive and both are so small, how could nature develop something like that
 
solvation shell:
 - water is polarized (hydrogens positive, oxygen negative) so the oxygen side faces the Na+ cation
 	- as such, the positive hydrogen side is facing away, outwards
 - these solvation shells are different sizes/shapes for Na+ and K+
 - as such, the ion filters take on different sizes so that it fits the solvation shell of only a certain cation
	- if spacing is just a bit off for sodium, it will be energetically unfavorable for it to pass through that channel
	- like a carefully tailored glove made to fit one person's hand

leakage channels:
 - passively allow certain ions to pass through
 - because potassium permeability is much higher than the other channels, potassium dominates the resting potential
	- however, any ion that can pass through the membrane (even a little) will have an effect

sodium-potassium pump:
 - need to maintain a gradient
 - continuall moves three sodium ions out of the cell, every two potassium ions it pumps into the cell
 - this pump uses ATP
	- this pump is so important that it consumes 70% of the ATP required for overall brain function
	- this is just to maintain an electrical gradient!
 - a third of everything you eat in a day goes to powering this pump

charge and voltage:
 - high voltage and low charge is like dropping a grain of rice from the empire state building
	- even though it's really high, mass is so small that it won't cause significant damage
 - on the contrary, low voltage and high charge is like dropping a bowling ball from knee height
	- even though it's low, mass is heavy enough to still hurt you

regions of the brain:
 - cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem
 - most of action in head is subserved by cranial nerves, and rest of body is controlled through spinal cord
 - reaching for apple, brain sends optic, etc info to spinal cord to make you reach for it
	- when you have apple, spinal cord sends info back (the sensation of feeling the apple)


Lesson 2 - Passive Membrane Properties

resistance:
 - a quantity that describes how much a conductor opposes the flow of charge through it
 - thicker wires have lower resistance (more cross area to flow through)
 - resistors are components with specifically calibrated resistors
 - measured in ohms
 - each type of ion channel has its own resistance
	- the more permeable a channel is, the lower the resistance
	- the more channels there are, the lower the resistance

membrane resistance:
 - the resistance of the flow of ions across the membrane
 - measured in ohms per square millimiter (ohm/mm^2)

axial resistance:
 - the resistance of the flow of ions down the axon

current:
 - the flow of charge through a conductor
 - represented by "I"

conductance:
 - inverse of resistance 
 - thick wire has higher resistance
 - different materials conduct differently 
	- eg. salt water vs copper
 - measured in siemens (inverse of ohm)

cytoplasm resistance:
 - important resistive quantity is the resistance of the cytoplasm through the cell
 - the saltier the cytoplasm, the lower its resistance
 - the wider the pipe the current flows through, the lower the resistance

water bottle example:
 - imagine holding a water bottle upside down and have water pour out
 - the voltage in this case is the potential energy (gravity water falling out)
 - the resistance is the diameter of the hole (restricts how much can flow out at a given time)

capacitance:
 - the arrangement of a membrane with inside fluid and outside fluid is basically a capacitor
 - a capacitor is a circuit element that can store a charge
 	- consists of two conductors separated by an insulating region called a dialectric

 - a good analogy is heating something up
	- if we blowtorch a plate of metal, it doesn't just instantly heat up to blowtorch temperature
	- rather it heats up in a curve, similar to a capacitors charging curve
		- fast then slows down as we approach temperature of blowtorch
	- when we remove plate, it doesn't return to room temperature instantly
		- cools off slowly, like a capacitor discharge

 - the neuronal membran is like a capacitor
	- builds up charge on both sides of the insulator (membrane)
		- one side will be negative, the other positive
	- capacitance will measure the ability to store charge, which for a neuron is the ability to store on the sides of the membrane

 - a larger surface area means more capacitance
 - thickness of membrane can also affect capacitance
	- the thicker the membrane, the more separation there is
	- this will reduce ability to accumulate charge and so decrease capacitance

 - using our water bottle example:
	- say we fill balloons with the water being poured
	- one balloon is very stretch and can hold more water (we can say that it has higher capacitance)
	- so if we fill balloons at same rate, the less stretchy one will reach max pressure faster than the stretchy one
	- different capacitances will affect how fast the membrane potential can change

ohm's law:
 - relationship between resistance, current, and voltage
 - I = V/R
 - voltage is proportional to current

 - water pump example:
	- let water pressure from pump be voltage
	- let flow rate of water in the pipe be current
	- let a restriction in the pipe be the resistance

	- if we keep restriction same, increase in water pressure will increase flow rate
	- changing these three factors will be same relationship as ohm's law

relationship to neurons:
 - the membrane acts like a capacitor (truthfully it's many capacitors side by side)
 - the channels act like resistors, altering the conductance and permeability
 - there is also resistance to current flow axially (along the neuron)

flow of ionic currents:
 - ions can flow across the membrane
 - ions can also flow down through the cytoplasm (down an axon)
 - therefore we need to think about two different resistances
	- membrane resistance (opposing flows across the membrane)
	- axial resistance (opposing flow of current through the cytoplasm)

varying membrane potential:
 - in a non-resting neuron, the membrane potential won't be the same everywhere across the membrane
 - if we change membrane potential at one spot of membrane, it will affect the neighboring parts of the membrane as well

length constant:
 - the distance it takes for a potential change to fall to about 36% of its initial value
 - represented by lambda
 - depends on both membrane and axial resistances
 - lambda = sqrt(R_mem/R_ax)

 - eg. 100mV charge at pointA, and the length constant at this neuron is 2mm
	- at pointB 2mm away from pointA, the voltage change will be 37% of 100mV ie. 37mV
	- at 6mm away from pointA, the voltage change will be 100*0.37^3 = 5mV

 - water analogy again:
	- decreased membrane resistance is liking having more holes in the water pipe
	- the more holes, the less farther it will travel
	- similarly, the increase in holes in the membrane will allow more leakage of current that flows down the axon
		- so current won't travel as far, so length constant will be lower

membrane capacitance:
 - nothing changes when we change capacitance with a static membrane potential
 - capacitance only begins to take effect when membrane voltage changes in time
	- decreasing capacitance made the membrane snappier (more responsive to change)
	- increasing capacitance made it more sluggish

 - if we want membrane to respond quickly, we either need different dielectric material, or make the membrane thicker

time constant:
 - t = R_mem * C_mem
 - like length constant, but instead of how far, we want to know how long
 - how long it takes a piece of membrane to charge up to 63% of its final value in response to a step change in input voltage

 - say we change voltage at pointA from 0 to 100mV
	- what is the voltage at pointB after 2s (pointB is 1mm away)

low pass filter:
 - allows low frequencies (slow changes) to pass while block high frequencies (fast changes)
