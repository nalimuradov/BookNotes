Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 1: Electric Properties of the Neuron

Lesson 2 - Passive Membrane Properties

resistance:
 - a quantity that describes how much a conductor opposes the flow of charge through it
 - thicker wires have lower resistance (more cross area to flow through)
 - resistors are components with specifically calibrated resistors
 - measured in ohms
 - each type of ion channel has its own resistance
	- the more permeable a channel is, the lower the resistance
	- the more channels there are, the lower the resistance

membrane resistance:
 - the resistance of the flow of ions across the membrane
 - measured in ohms per square millimiter (ohm/mm^2)

axial resistance:
 - the resistance of the flow of ions down the axon

current:
 - the flow of charge through a conductor
 - represented by "I"

conductance:
 - inverse of resistance 
 - thick wire has higher resistance
 - different materials conduct differently 
	- eg. salt water vs copper
 - measured in siemens (inverse of ohm)

cytoplasm resistance:
 - important resistive quantity is the resistance of the cytoplasm through the cell
 - the saltier the cytoplasm, the lower its resistance
 - the wider the pipe the current flows through, the lower the resistance

water bottle example:
 - imagine holding a water bottle upside down and have water pour out
 - the voltage in this case is the potential energy (gravity water falling out)
 - the resistance is the diameter of the hole (restricts how much can flow out at a given time)

capacitance:
 - the arrangement of a membrane with inside fluid and outside fluid is basically a capacitor
 - a capacitor is a circuit element that can store a charge
 	- consists of two conductors separated by an insulating region called a dialectric

 - a good analogy is heating something up
	- if we blowtorch a plate of metal, it doesn't just instantly heat up to blowtorch temperature
	- rather it heats up in a curve, similar to a capacitors charging curve
		- fast then slows down as we approach temperature of blowtorch
	- when we remove plate, it doesn't return to room temperature instantly
		- cools off slowly, like a capacitor discharge

 - the neuronal membran is like a capacitor
	- builds up charge on both sides of the insulator (membrane)
		- one side will be negative, the other positive
	- capacitance will measure the ability to store charge, which for a neuron is the ability to store on the sides of the membrane

 - a larger surface area means more capacitance
 - thickness of membrane can also affect capacitance
	- the thicker the membrane, the more separation there is
	- this will reduce ability to accumulate charge and so decrease capacitance

 - using our water bottle example:
	- say we fill balloons with the water being poured
	- one balloon is very stretch and can hold more water (we can say that it has higher capacitance)
	- so if we fill balloons at same rate, the less stretchy one will reach max pressure faster than the stretchy one
	- different capacitances will affect how fast the membrane potential can change

ohm's law:
 - relationship between resistance, current, and voltage
 - I = V/R
 - voltage is proportional to current

 - water pump example:
	- let water pressure from pump be voltage
	- let flow rate of water in the pipe be current
	- let a restriction in the pipe be the resistance

	- if we keep restriction same, increase in water pressure will increase flow rate
	- changing these three factors will be same relationship as ohm's law

relationship to neurons:
 - the membrane acts like a capacitor (truthfully it's many capacitors side by side)
 - the channels act like resistors, altering the conductance and permeability
 - there is also resistance to current flow axially (along the neuron)

flow of ionic currents:
 - ions can flow across the membrane
 - ions can also flow down through the cytoplasm (down an axon)
 - therefore we need to think about two different resistances
	- membrane resistance (opposing flows across the membrane)
	- axial resistance (opposing flow of current through the cytoplasm)

varying membrane potential:
 - in a non-resting neuron, the membrane potential won't be the same everywhere across the membrane
 - if we change membrane potential at one spot of membrane, it will affect the neighboring parts of the membrane as well

length constant:
 - the distance it takes for a potential change to fall to about 36% of its initial value
 - represented by lambda
 - depends on both membrane and axial resistances
 - lambda = sqrt(R_mem/R_ax)

 - eg. 100mV charge at pointA, and the length constant at this neuron is 2mm
	- at pointB 2mm away from pointA, the voltage change will be 37% of 100mV ie. 37mV
	- at 6mm away from pointA, the voltage change will be 100*0.37^3 = 5mV

 - water analogy again:
	- decreased membrane resistance is liking having more holes in the water pipe
	- the more holes, the less farther it will travel
	- similarly, the increase in holes in the membrane will allow more leakage of current that flows down the axon
		- so current won't travel as far, so length constant will be lower

membrane capacitance:
 - nothing changes when we change capacitance with a static membrane potential
 - capacitance only begins to take effect when membrane voltage changes in time
	- decreasing capacitance made the membrane snappier (more responsive to change)
	- increasing capacitance made it more sluggish

 - if we want membrane to respond quickly, we either need different dielectric material, or make the membrane thicker

time constant:
 - t = R_mem * C_mem
 - like length constant, but instead of how far, we want to know how long
 - how long it takes a piece of membrane to charge up to 63% of its final value in response to a step change in input voltage

 - say we change voltage at pointA from 0 to 100mV
	- what is the voltage at pointB after 2s (pointB is 1mm away)

low pass filter:
 - allows low frequencies (slow changes) to pass while block high frequencies (fast changes)
