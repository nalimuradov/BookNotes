Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 2: Neurons and Networks

Lesson 3 - Small Circuits

synaptic integration:
 - how neurons combine information from many synapses at once

neuron communication:
 - neurons receive input signals on their dendrites
 - input information in the cell body (soma)
 - determine whether or not to send output signal through axon to the presynaptic terminal

circuits:
 - our nervous sytem is highly interconnected in circuits
 - for example, we have a specific circuit for fear perception
	- or short and long term memory storage

information processing:
 - excitatory signals are typically received on the dendritic spines
 - inhibitory signals are typically received on the dendritic shafts, soma, or axon initial segment

synaptic distance and efficacy:
 - one key factor that influences synaptic integration is the distance between the synapse and the cell body
 - like a tree branch, the tips of the dendrites grow thinner
	- this reduces the length constant, as the axial resistance becomes higher
	- as such, there is a greater signal loss

the five critical factors that regulate synaptic integration:
 - distance
 - synaptic summation
 - synaptic inhibition
 - synaptic temporal summation
 - synaptic temporal inhibition

synaptic summation:
 - like distance, this also affects the efficacy of a synapse
 - when summing EPSPs, it's non-linear
	- looks like it's adding two together, but not necessarily

 - source of nonlinearity:
	- driving force (as we get coser to membrane potential, driving force becomes lower)
	- dendritic action potentials
	- action potential backpropogation (potentials passively conduct current back into dendritic arbor)

synaptic inhibition:
 - also known as shunting
 - precise placement of these synapses is important
 	- an inhibitory synapse close to the soma can cancel out many EPSPs as it is close to the core
	- however an IPSP at the denritic arbor can only shunt the EPSPs upstream of the dendritic arbor

synaptic temporal summation:
 - the case where a synapse fires multiple times in rapid succession
 - we know that multiple post-synaptic potentials sum up in the receiving neuron, but not in a linear way
	- we have to consider what happens when the same synapse is activated multiple times before cell is able to return to resting potential
 - when we fire a synapse multiple times, the amplitude is much larger and the shape is not the same

synaptic temporal inhibition:
 - the case where inhibitory synapses can affect the signal
	- for example, we can have E -> I -> E signal which will appear as a single E signal

example:
 - you receive signals from a variety of inputs, both excitatory and inhibitory
 - these converge to a neuron which will or will not activate, which will further continue to another neuron
 - like receiving info from vision, touch, and then using that to do something else

convergence, divergence, and recurrence:
 - this is how information spreads throughout neuronal circuits
 - these are the three most basic principles of neural network organization

convergence/divergence:
 - when multiple inputs come together to synapse on a single downstream neuron
 - brain is constantly bringing together scraps of information to synthesize into a coherent whole
 - eg. rustling in grass and seeing a figure can send signal of fear
	- heart rate rises, breathing hastens, pupils dilate
	- those neurons DIVERGE to cause the above changes in our body

reccurence:
 - describes the situation where some chain of connected neurons loops back to itself (feedback loop)
 - eg. neuron A connects to neuron B but B then also sends its axon back to A
 - reccurent connections can be excitatory or inhibitory

central pattern generator:
 - also known as CPG
 - a neuronal network that can produce patterned outputs, even in absence of ongoing sensory input
	- like a fish wagging its tail back and forth, neur A back and forth to neur B

 - for example, walking is down through a CPG
	- the contraction of our muscles that allow us to walk is driven by pattern generators outside of the brain

 - this can arise when say neur A makes neur B fire, and neur B makes neur A fire after a delay
	- this pattern with enough neurons can give rise to complex systems
