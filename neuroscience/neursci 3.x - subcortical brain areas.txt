Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 3: The Brain

Lesson x - Subcortical Brain Areas

hindbrain:
 - aka rhombencepha;pm
 - lowest part of the brain, contiguous with the spinal cord (at the bottom of the brain in humans)

 - controls functions like heart rate, respiration, and swallowing
	- this is the core of life
	- in many animals it is their brain's only function

 - the hindbrain refers to the medulla, the pons, and the cerebellum
	- medulla and pons are part of the brainstem

 - most injuries to the brain stem result in instant death

midbrain:
 - associated with vision, hearing, motor control, arousal, alertness
 - the tectum is the top part of the mid brain and controls auditory and visual reflexes
 - more involved in voluntary body movenet, rather than basic reflexes of the hindbrain

brain stem -> limbic system -> cortex

brain stem:
 - basic life support, extends from the spinal cord
 - we are not aware of most of waht the brain is doing
	
limbic system:
 - core valuations
 - we are not actively aware of feelings on our skin, but when a bug lands on your arm you instantly know
 - amygdala controls fear and aggression

cortex:
 - thinking brain

cerebellum:
 - seperate structure at the bottom of the brain
 - contains 50% of the brain's neurons

our senses:
 - sound waves are produced whensomething vibrates and causes disturbance in a medium
 - light waves are photons we see when light reflects off of objects
 - in the same way our body can sense temperature, we have evolved to sense above senses (as it's obviously useful)

forebrain:
 - encompasses four main functional systems:
	- cerebral cortex
 	- basal ganglia
	- thalamus
	- limbic system

ALL regions:
 - midbrain
 - hindbrain
 - forebrain
 - cerebellum
 - basal ganglia
 - thalamus
 - limbic system
 - hippocampus
 - hypothalamus


the brain has 3 main parts:
 - cerebrum
 - cerebellum
 - brain stem

cerebrum:
 - largest portion, only mammals have this
 - frontal, parietal, occipital lobes
 - visual functions, language, judgment, problem solving

cerebellum:
 - evolved before cerebrum, controls body functions like balance, coordination

limbic system:
 - contains glands which help relay emotions, fear, memories, etc
 - amygdala: fear and aggression
 - hippocampus: learning and memory
 - hypothalamus: mood, thirst, hunger
 - thalamus: attention span, pain sensation

brain stem:
 - all basic life functions, nearly all animals have this, many animals have ONLY this as the brain
 - midbrain: regulate body movement, vision, hearing
 - pons: motor control
 - medulla: vital body functions like breathing
