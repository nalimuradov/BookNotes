Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 1: Electric Properties of the Neuron

Lesson 4 - Action Potential Propagation

why use action potential?
 - there is a meter distance from spinal cord to end of arm
 - if i were to pick up a cup of coffee, it would take a year for diffusion to carry the signal across this distance
 - by that time, the coffee would have evaporated
 - so why use action potential? because we need to act fast

current leak:
 - neurons need to combat current leak when sending an electrical signal down an axon
 - one way is to make the magnitude of the action potential much larger, however neurons are already almost at their breaking point 
	- membranes are only a few nanometers thick so it's not far off from the breakdown voltage (where lipid bilayer stops acting as an insulator)

 - what nature does:
	- repeatedly regenerate the signal to get it down the axon
	- so rather than moving a molecule down the axon (electros down the wire), we instead move the state of depolarization down the axon

signals as state:
 - when there is a wave in the water, the water is moving up and down
	- we can transmit a wave through the water without moving the water
 - in the same way, we can transmit information along an axon by propogating the state of depolarization down it 
	- all this without any net movement of molecules or ions

 - an action potential in one area of the membrane depolarizes the next region, which fires an action potential there
	- this then depolarizes the region after that, and fires an action potential there
	- like a domino effect
	- the signal will propogate from the cell body to its target (like a muscle fiber or another neuron)

 - delay in change:
	- in copper if we change potential in one area, it changes everywhere else pretty much instantaneously
 	- then why is there a delay in the spike when we increase voltage?

 - thanks to action potential propagation, motor neuron axons can send signals across several meters

absolute refractory period:
 - after an action potential, the vg-sodium channels are inactivated, which makes it impossible to trigger another action potential
 - the initial rise (first third)

relative refractory period:
 - when sodium channels are active again but still fighting against those extra open potassium channels
 - here it's hard to stimulate action potential but not impossible
 - the drop and dip as it goes back up to resting (middle third)

colliding action potentials:
 - if we make two action potentials collide, they will hit each other and cancel out
 - researches exploit this by stimulate one signal at neuron of interest and the other at the location they think it sends the axon
	- if stimulation in these two locations leads to no measurable action potential
		- then it is likely that the two propagating potentials traveled on the same axon and collided (canceled out)
 - with this info, we can confirm where a neuron sends its signals

speeding up the action potential:
 - neurons can change their properties to optimize the spread of signals
