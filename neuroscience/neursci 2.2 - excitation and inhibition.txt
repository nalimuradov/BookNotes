Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 2: Neurons and Networks

Lesson 2 - Excitation and Inhibition

two main categories of synapses:
 - excitatory synapses: synapses that increase activity of postsynaptic neuron
 - inhibitory synapses: synapses that decrease activity of postsynaptic neuron

 - in the presynaptic terminal it's calm
 - in the postsynaptic terminal:
 	- fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials are mediated primarily by cation selective ion channels
	- fast inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are mediated primarily by anion selective ion channels

lifecycle of a neurotransmitter:
 - a neurotransmitter diffuses at a rate of 0.05 miles per hour, faster than a snail
 - once released, a neurotransmitter has one of five fates
	- can travel across synaptic cleft and bind to its dedicated receptor
	- other four below..?

 - mechanisms are needed to shut off neurotransmitter action in the cleft before simply diffusing away
	- otherwise a neurotransmitter can unbind and rebind until diffused away (reactivating the cell over and over)
	- four such mechanisms are known to date:
		- after crossing cleft, neurotransmitter is resorbed into the postsynaptic cell	
		- neurotransmitters are broken down into enzymes present in the cleft
		- neurotransmitters can be taken by transporter proteins
		- finally, combinations of the above are also possible

EPSPs and IPSPs:
 - scientists use three criteria to describe a synapse:
	- its overall effect on the postsynaptic neurons (excitation vs inhibition)
	- its speed (fast vs slow, milliseconds vs 100x slower)
	- its strength

 - excitation and inhibition are largely defined by what they do to the postsynaptic membrane potential
	- excitatory synapses promote firing of downstream neuron
		- membrane potential of postsynaptic neuron moves away from its resting potential to a more positive value
		- deflection of membrane potential closer to threshold makes it more likely for the neuron to fire
	- the resulting signal in postsynaptic neuron is an EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential)

EPSPs:
 - the action of acetylcholine on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction
	- this is a fast and strong EPSP
	- both nicotine and acetylcholine neurotransmitters can open the receptors

 - acetylcholine receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel
	- it opens when the ligand (a specific chemical) binds to it
	- composed of two alpha subunits, and one gamma, beta, delta subunit
		- each subunit has four membrane-spanning domains (M1, M2, M3, M4)
			- M2 lies in the central pore

	- roughly 300 000 acetylcholine receptors are active at the NMJ during synaptic transmission

	- acetylcholine binds to two alpha subunits -> ligand-induced change in 3d structure occurs -> postsynaptic neuron is depolarized to -35mV

nicotinic acetylcholine receptors:
 - these are found at the neuromuscular junction
 - this receptor conducts sodium, potassium, and calcium too (all cations)
	- all cations because the central pore of channel is lined with negatively charged amino acids from the M2 subunit

 - reversal potential for this receptor is at -10mV (the average of the nernst potentials of sodium and potassium)
	- in a neuron, there is more Na+ outside the cell and more K+ inside the cell
	- they will flow until equilibrium

 - ion channels which let more than one ion pass simultaneously will always show reversing potential which controls their ability to depolarize postsynaptic cell
	- to trigger an action potential

 - to avoid unwanted excitation/inhibition, individual channels will close if they have been open for a long time due to binding/unbinding
	- this process is called desensitization

 - many venoms block this receptors neurotransmission, which causes weakness to the skeletal muscles
	- if enough of a dose, this will lead to death by asphyxiation due to the paralysis of the diaphragm

inward currents:
 - when positive ions move into the neuron
 - or when negative ions move out of the neuron
 - as such, inward currents are negative

outward currents:
 - when positive ions move out of the neuron
 - or when negative ions move into the neuron
 - as such, outward currents are positive

equilibrium potential:
 - AKA nernst potential
 - the membrane potential at which there is no net flow of said ion through the membrane
 - does not depend on what channels are present in the membrane
	- each ionic species has its own equilibrium potential

reversal potential:
 - the membrane potential at which net current through said channel is zero
 - focuses on the movement of ions through a specific channel
 - when a channel is permeable to only one ion, then reversal potential is equal to equilibrium potential of that ion
	- eg. GABA receptors only permeable to chloride, therefore reverse potential is -65mV (same as eq potential)
 - however when a channel is permeable to multiple ions:
	- reversal potential is equal to the weighted avg of those ions' nernst potentials (eq potentials)

excitation disease states:
 - myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that leads to muscle weakness and fatigue
	- caused by circulating antibodies in the blood that block or destroy acetylcholine receptors of the postsynaptic NMJ
	- as such, acetylcholine cannot bind to the receptor and excite the postsynaptic cell, so can't stimulate muscle contraction

glutamate:
 - naturally occuring amino acid, can act as a neurotransmitter
 - responsivle for all fast EPSPs in the central nervous system (as opposed to the NMJ we've been discussing before)

ionotropic receptors:
 - ion channels themselves and directly let ions pass

metabotropic receptors:
 - change the metabolic and biochemical pathways acting indirectly through G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)
	- GPCRs are not ion channels, rather they sense molecules outside the cell and activate specific pathways and responses inside the cell
	- GPCRs comprise of 4% to 5% of known protein coding human genome
		- however they are also the target of 40% of all modern medicinal drugs

AMPA receptors:
 - most commonly found receptor in the nervous system
 - permeable to all cations like the acetylcholine receptors
 - ligand-gated
 - in glutamatergic synapses, there are usually both AMPA and NMDA receptors

NMDA receptors:
 - also permeable to all cations
 - young brains have NMDA receptors only
 - n-methyl-d-aspartate binds to these receptors
 - these receptors have roles in many cognitive functions such as synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory
 - can be both activated by ligand binding as well as changes in the membrane potential
 - needs an initial depolarization to have a chance to open
	- the NMDA receptor itself is voltage-dependent
	- the initial depolarization is usually brought by opening of AMPA receptors which are found at the same synapses
	- therefore, NMDA receptors work as 'coincidence detectors'
		- they get activated when glutamate released into cleft (presynaptic event) as well as when AMPA receptors get activated (postsynaptic event)

IPSPs:
 - vast majority of IPSPs in central nervous system are due to the action of ligand-gated ion channels (GABA and glycine receptors)
 - GABA receptors are the primary IPSP-generating receptors in the brain
 - glycine receptors (which bind to the amino acid glycine) are the primary IPSP-generating receptors in the spinal cord
 - both are very similar to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors from before

 - big difference in these two receptors is that the M2 domain in each receptor subunit is lined by either neutral or positive amino acids (not negative like before0
	- both GABA and glycine receptors are anion-selective ion channels
		- this causes increase in chlorine conductance

 - IPSPs are important for when a neuron is trying to avoid a 'go' signal
	- while excitatory synapses are trying to depolarize neuron, inhibitory synapses can maintain a neuron at resting potential
		- this is called 'shunting'
		- describes the fact the negative chloride can counterbalance positive sodium, resulting in stop signal

 - for example, strychnine is used in rat poison
	- the blockade if the receptor causes muscular convulsion due to the LOSS OF INHIBITORY ACTION

hyperekplexia:
 - neurological disorder when person has exagerrated startle response to external stimuli through touch or sound
 - caused by loss of inhibitory synaptic function during glycine neurotransmission
