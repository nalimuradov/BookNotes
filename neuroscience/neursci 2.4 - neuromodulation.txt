Fundamentals of Neuroscience - Part 2: Neurons and Networks

Lesson 4 - Neuromodulation

components in a synapse:
 - the two main components we've learned about are the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals
 - however, there is a third one: neuromodulation
	- neuromodulation is a third neuron that modulates the synaptic strength of synapses

neuromodulation:
 - the process by which synaptic transmission between two neurons is either enhanced or decreased
	- through the action of a third substance called a neuromodulator
 - like two person conversation, and third person comes along
	- if p3 likes you, conversation between p1 and p2 will be better
	- if p3 doesnt, conversation will be worse
	- p3 is a neuromodulator

 - most neuromodulators act through GPCRs (g-protein-coupled receptors)
	- they can also act through voltage gated ion channels

synaptic connections:
 - whether you're reading a book or going for a walk, synaptic connections are changing their strength
 - synaptic connection changes can either be structural or non-structural
	- structural changes include alteration of number by loss/addition, or change in size by shrinkage/growth
		- these occur normally throughout life
		- eg. when you're young lots of neurons being made, but also when you have alzheimers (neurons destroyed)

 - neuromodulation is what changes these synaptic connections

neurodegeneration:
 - alzheimers and parkinsons are neurodegenerative diseases
 - neuronal death is accelerated compared to healthy patients
	- like seeing a family member's face not register with you (cuz those neurons have been destroyed)

ionotropic/metabotropic receptors:
 - the neurotransmitter doesn't decide whether effects are inhibitory or excitatory
 	- rather, it acts as a signal to act
 - the action the neuron takes depends on what postsynaptic receptor molecules receive that signal
	- the postynaptic receptor determines what effect a given neurotransmitter has

 - as discussed, the two main types of receptors are IONOTROPIC and METABOTROPIC
	- ionotropic receptors induce fast changes in postsynaptic membrane potential
		- these receptors are specific for a certain neurotransmitter, and the neurotransmitter is like a key (opens/closes channel)
		- upon binding, ionotropic channels open a central pore that allows ion flow across membrane, which modulates the potential
	- metabotropic receptors are GPCRs (g-protein coupled receptors)
		- these receptors are much slower
		- they induce changes in the electrical and biochemical properties of the postsynaptic neuron
		- they are not channels, so they don't allow charges to pass through the membrane directly
			- they act through the activation of intracellular signalling cascades in the postsynaptic cell through messenger molecules
		- one molecule causes a change in another, which changes another, etc

	- many fast-acting ionotropic neurotransmitters can also act as neuromodulators through metabotropic receptors
		- as such, a single neurotransmitter can act immediately, while also having long-lasting actions

GPCRs:
 - g-protein coupled receptors
 - metabotropic receptors belong to this family of receptors
 - ligand is bound outside of the cell
	- this affects function of g-proteins inside the cell

serotonin:
 - a neuromodulator system that is involved in many processes such as hunger, sleep, and mood
 - receptors are found in many parts of the brain (hippocampus, neocortex, amygdala, thalamus)
 - plays a large role in mood -> depression, therefore it's a target of most anti-depressive drugs
 - also important, serotonin plays roles in the gut, regulating gastrointestinal functions
	- this double duty is common in biology 
	- however, drugs that affect serotonin can have off-target effects 

neuropeptides:
 - proteins that 5 to 20 amino acids long
	- much larger than a classical neurotransmitter
 - act as neuromodulators exclusively through GPCRs

opioids:
 - a class of neuropeptides
 - deal with the perception of pain
 - there are 4 kinds of opioid receptors: delta, mu, kappa, nociceptin

dopamine:
 - the dopamine system modulates many modalities, such as motor control, arousal, motivation, and reward
 - cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine to the synaptic cleft
	- increases the time the neurotransmitter spends in the cleft, increasing likelihood of inserting a post-synaptic action

noradrenaline system:
 - pathway that is likely to be activated when encountering a dangerous situation

conclusion:
 - neuromodulation is the process by which the synaptic transmission between two neurons is enhanced/decreased through a third substance (neuromodulator)
 - neuromodulators can affect neurotransmitter release, receptor sensitivity, and protein synthesis
 - this diversity of neuromodulatory effects comes from the diversity of the neuromodulatory pathways
 - the main neuromodulatory systems are: serotonin, neuropeptides, dopamine, acetylcholine, noradrenaline
