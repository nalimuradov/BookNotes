substance use addiction:
 - drug/alcohol addictions for example
 - oftentimes, quitting cold turkey is the only solution for these problems
 - lots of our behavioural addiction remedies are based off of substance use addictions
 - handled incorrectly by law
	- you cannot punish pain out of people

behavioural addictions:
 - include things like video game addiction and social media addiction
 - these are new addictions that are being treated as substances due to lack of research
 - not saying that substance use addiction solutions can't help, but this is a new disease

 - behavioural addictions are fundamentally different, they do something for us:
	- provide us with a sense of accomplishment, growth, relationships
	- that is why we play them, and taking it away like that is like taking away all your friends
	- eg. kid who played fortnite, parents didn't realize that all of his friends are online
		- taking it away will make it worse (alone/suicidal)
 - need to replace with other activities that fulfill that need
 
 - to play video games without being addicted:
	- you have to get the stuff the game gives you from other sources
	- if it is your only source of achievement in life, you will be addicted
	- as such, don't need to quit gaming to break addiction

 - if the only place you get confidence is from your challenger rank in league, you won't want to leave
	- especially if you have no confidence in real life
	- can't just take it away, will just be left with no confidence

trauma:
 - every case of addiction originates from trauma
 - eg. aboriginal example
 - addiction isn't the problem we face, it is us trying to solve the problem
 - gabor mate addiction to work example:
	- if you grow up feeling unwanted, you will try to cope with it however you can
	- for example, addicted to work being a doctor, because you are wanted all the time

 - trauma is passed on, unwillingly, unnoticed, through every day behaviours

dissociation:
 - when you are threatened, you typically can either fight, escape, or ask for help
 - if none of those options are available to you, your brain tries to protect you and dissociate you from the experience
 - eg. parents divorcing arguing
	- you can't fight back, escape, and too scared to ask for help
	- so what do you do, you tune out, dissociate yourself from it

treatment:
 - what did you get out of it, what was missing from your life that it gave you 
 - whatever was missing, how did you lose it

brain development:
 - unlike other species (horses), humans are born underdeveloped
 	- compare to horses who are able to run the day they are born	
 - as such, 90% of brain development happens after birth in the early years of life
 - this is when a large effect on genes and behaviour can take place

respectable addictions:
 - some addictions like addiction to work are more respected (praised even) than others like heroin
 - one is rewarded, and the other is ostracized
