04 - Molecular Genetics I

proteins:
 - play the most important role in molecular genetics
 - hold the shapes of cells together
 - they form messengers, hormones, neurotransmitters, etc
 - a string of amino acids

minor protein changes:
 - small mutations in proteins can cascade into massive changes (opposite reproductive organ)
 - a mutation that causes a 1% increase in reproductive success can be massive
	- come back later and that mutation will be everywhere

genes:
 - genes specify for antlers, petals, kidneys, etc
 - when people say we share 98% of genes with chimps, it means that we share many of the genes coding for the same things
	- we have genes coding for a pelvis (allowing bipedal movements), chins, etc
	- you won't find these genes in apple trees for example
	- so if you look at the big picture, 98% of the genes we have code for similar things
 - and when people say we share 50% genes with our sibling:
	- it's not if we both have genes for the same things (like opposable thumbs)
	- it's if we both have the same types of opposable thumbs

evolution is not driven by small gradual changes:
 - instead, there are long periods of nothing and then short bursts of evolution
	 - eg. environment change, adaptations
 - repeating long periods of stasis and dramatic changes
 - it's still millions of years for the changes, doesn't imply it's fast, just that it happens
