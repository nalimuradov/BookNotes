03 - Behavioural Evolution II

infanticide:
 - a common misconception in the 70s was that humans were the only species who killed
 - not only is this wrong, but some species go farther, such as killing children
	- eg. certain monkeys (adult males) target children of other adult male monkeys
 - then why doesn't every tournament species have competitive infanticide?
	- turns out, it only happens when the female birth interval is longer than the tenure of a high ranking male
	- if a male gets a high ranking status, it can be the case where all the females already have children
		- as such, they won't want to reproduce for another two years, which by then the male will have already been dethroned
	- therefore their best solution is infanticide
 - animals that do this include langer monkeys, lions, and gorillas
	- however, they do not kill if the children are of their relatives (kin selection)
 - in some species (eg. rodents), the presence of a new male causes a female to miscarry, to avoid the above situation
	- either they give birth and then be killed, or give up now and salvage as much as possible
 - it is important to note that none of these things are conscious efforts by the animals
	- this is all programmed into them, with the goal of passing on their genes
	- they cannot sit there and ponder these things or look to the future

boy or girl:
 - say you were a monkey that was giving birth and you had a choice, would you want a male or a female?
 - it becomes a question of how much does it cost vs the potential reproductive success
	- eg. in species where 5% of males do 95% of mating, there is a high chance a boy you give birth to won't pass down any genes
		- however, there is a small chance that the male will pass down a lot of genes, so it's like gambling
		- giving birth to a girl in this case is like a safe bet, as they have higher chance of passing down genes but not a lot
 - a high ranking male will more likely have males, as they will reproduce a lot and may hit the 5% jackpot again with another male
 - a low ranking male will more likely have females, as it is safer, and having a male that also doesn't pass on genes ends your bloodline

intersexual competition:
 - there is plenty of competition not only between species, but between genders of the same species
 - while both want a child to pass their genes, they also have other goals that conflict
 - eg. bird example:
	- males in certain species of birds often want to reproduce, but must build a nest for the female first
	- this acts as an insurance policy for the female, making the male put in work before reproducing
		- otherwise, conniving males may just mate and leave, so females have adapted
	- by building the nest, the males have already put in so much effort that they'll just see it through to the end

cooperational evolution:
 - say we have a species and 10% becomes isolated from a river forming
 	- that 10% will eventually become more inbred than the other 90%
 - because that 10% is more related to each other, kin selection dictates that they will be much more cooperative
 - now what if we reintroduce that 10% to that 90%:
	- the 10% will begin to outcompete the rest so the 90% must join in with the cooperation
 - this is called the founder effect

chins:
 - adaptiveness theories attempt to create a story for every evolutionary result
 - eg. why do humans have chins?
	- someone can say that we evolved them to use them to stab others, or get crumbs out of the corner, or whatever
	- in reality, it is just a side effect
		- humans couldn't have evolved a flat face and a jaw at our angle without a chin
		- it just happened due to other things, there was no divine evolutionary benefit that required humans to evolve chins
 - it's important to realize that not everything we have was carefully evolved for
	- a lot of it is just excess baggage from other things that was carried along

punctuated evolution:
 - species don't evolve very gradually like a curve
 - it is more like a staircase graph
	- nothing for a while and then a short burst of lots of changes, then another while of nothing and another short burst, and repeat
