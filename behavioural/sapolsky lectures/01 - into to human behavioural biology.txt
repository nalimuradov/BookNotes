01 - Intro to Human Behavioural Biology

categories:
 - our human brain works by categorizing things into buckets
 - when we see something, we compare it to our previous categorical buckets to evaluate it
 - eg. running a mile in under 4 minutes is impressive
 - eg. a painter that paints with 11 colours isn't impressive
	- we don't evaluate painting quality by the number of colours used
 - taking a continuum and breaking into pieces makes it easier to work with and remember
