promoters:
 - can have significant impacts on human behaviour
 - eg. having more of a promoter can make you more likely to have a divorce

co-evolutionary racing:
 - we evolve antibodies for parasite who then evolve mechanism to avoid it, and repeat

glucorticoids:
 - cortisol (hydrocortisone) is the most important human glucocorticoid
 - essential for life, regulates many human functions (cardiovascular, metabolic, homeostatic, etc)
