02 - Behavioural Evolution

physical/behavioural relationship:
 - so much behavioural info about animals can be determined by their physical features
 - eg. skull sizes between males and females
	- can determine chance of cheating, attractive features, etc.

heritable traits:
 - traits that can be passed from one generation to the next
 - there is variability among traits when passed down
 - some versions of traits are more adaptive than others
	- eg. bigger giraffe hearts lets it pump blood farther up neck
	- as such, these traits are more likely to be passed down
 - will result in evolution in populations

wildebeest example:
 - herd of wildebeest trying to cross river but infested with crocodiles
 - older wildebeest pushes himself to front and sacrifices himself for others
	- sounds noble, but this propogates the lie that animals act for the good of the species
	- IN REALITY, animals behave in a way to pass on as many copies of their genes as possible
 - in reality, the wildebeest was pushed by others to the front

natural vs sexual selection:
 - natural selection refers to traits where there is a benefit to the individual in terms of survival (eg. bigger moose antlers)
 - sexual selection refers to traits with no benefit, other than looking cool (eg. green color of antlers attracting more mates)
 - sometimes, these two may be conflicting:
	- a bright colored fish may be more desirable by mates, but more likely to be seen and eaten by predators

individual selection:
 - passing on your own genes in order to maximize gene propagation into the next generation

kin selection:
 - we share 100% of genes with an identical twin, 50% with a sibling, 25% with half-siblings, etc.
 - logically, you are as successful in propagating your genes if you forego reproducing and help your identical twin reproduce
 - as such, evolution selects for organisms cooperating with their relatives (kin selection)

aggression triangle:
 - if an organism has the power to overpower another organism, there is a case when it won't
 - rock paper scissors effect
 - if organism A can poison organism B at the cost of energy, it can eat organism B
	- however, the cost in energy exposes it to organism C, which can now eat it
 - what ends up happening is a stalemate where nothing happens
 - it's not cooperation, more like a truce
	- sometimes, this truce turns into cooperation

why cooperate?:
 - one can argue that an organism can simply kill everything in sight and backstab everyone
 - in reality, many hands make the task easier
 - furthermore, killing others isn't even surefire as you risk damage or death
 - reciprocal altruism is simply better in terms of survival (cooperation among non relatives)
	- this can occur at all levels, including single-celled organisms (not just evolved mammals)
		- eg. fruiting body bacteria reproduction attempts at cheating
 - important to be vigilant about others cheating you, otherwise will get taken advantage of

tit-for-tat:
 - most optimal prisoners dillemma solution
 - start off cooperating
 - if they cooperate, you cooperate
 - if they cheat, you cheat
 - if they go back to cooperation, you go back too
 - tit-for-tat may lose some battles (in edge cases), but it wins the war (long run)

forgiving tit-for-tat:
 - if both organisms are doing tit-for-tat, must account for the possibility of noise (wrong signal being sent)
 - eg. if a wrong cheating signal is sent to other, they will cheat in return
	- as such, the original organism will cheat, and the other will cheat, and an endless loop of cheating began because of a false signal
 - to combat this, we can offer one free pass:
	- if they cheat, still forgive
	- if they cheat again, then cheat back
 - can optimize this even further:
	- start off tit-for-tat
	- if gone long time without cheating, move to forgiving tit-for-tat

vampire bats:
 - female vampire bats share nests near other female bats (not related to each other)
 - they get blood from cows and distribute the blood to every baby (each mom feeds all babies)
 - experiment:
	- can pump one vampire bats throat with air so it looks like it's full with blood
	- other bats will think they have lots of blood and aren't sharing
	- next time they feed, the vampire bats don't feed the child of the bat with air filled throat

stickleback fish:
 - put mirror in tank to make it look like an enemy
 - put a mirror beside the fish to make it look like an ally
 - if we angle the mirror back, it will look like the new ally is cheating by sitting back
 - as such, the next time it happens, the stickleback won't attack reflection until ally does
	- tit-for-tatting its ally

simultaneous tit-for-tats:
 - animals don't play prisoners dillema at the basic level, many games can occur at the same time
 - higher levels of species introduce role diversification
 - eg. naked mole rats that eat alot of food and don't do work, why are they not being punished?
	- when the rainy season comes, they are the ones plugging the entrance and risking their lives
 - it is essentially tit-for-tat in more than one area

male female dimorphism:
 - if males and females in a species have vastly different body sizes, they typically have the following traits:
	- high aggression among males
	- low percent of males father high percent of the children
	- females seek out bigger males
	- low parental behaviour among males
	- lower lifespan among males than females, as there is a high chance for injury, death, or famine (lots of muscles need lots of food)
 	- low chance for twins to be born, and high chance for one to get killed if they are born
	- low cheating among females, as they are the only ones taking care of the children (and investment is lost)
	- often known as a tournament species (eg. peacocks, chickens, baboons)
 - if males and females have similar body sizes, then they typically have the following traits:
	- low aggression between males
	- most males father equal amount of children, though not as many
	- females seek out males based on parental skills
	- high parental behaviour among males
 	- typically equal lifespan between males and females
	- higher chance for twins to be born
 	- higher chance for females to cheat
	- often known as a pair-bonding (monogamous) species (eg. marmosets)
