02 - Behavioural Evolution

physical/behavioural relationship:
 - so much behavioural info about animals can be determined by their physical features
 - eg. skull sizes between males and females
	- can determine chance of cheating, attractive features, etc.

heritable traits:
 - traits that can be passed from one generation to the next
 - there is variability among traits when passed down
 - some versions of traits are more adaptive than others
	- eg. bigger giraffe hearts lets it pump blood farther up neck
	- as such, these traits are more likely to be passed down
 - will result in evolution in populations

wildebeest example:
 - herd of wildebeest trying to cross river but infested with crocodiles
 - older wildebeest pushes himself to front and sacrifices himself for others
	- sounds noble, but this propogates the lie that animals act for the good of the species
	- IN REALITY, animals behave in a way to pass on as many copies of their genes as possible
 - in reality, the wildebeest was pushed by others to the front

natural vs sexual selection:
 - natural selection refers to traits where there is a benefit to the individual in terms of survival (eg. bigger moose antlers)
 - sexual selection refers to traits with no benefit, other than looking cool (eg. green color of antlers attracting more mates)
 - sometimes, these two may be conflicting:
	- a bright colored fish may be more desirable by mates, but more likely to be seen and eaten by predators

relatives:
 - we share 100% of genes with an identical twin, 50% with a sibling, 25% with half-siblings, etc.
 - logically, you are as successful in propogating your genes if you forego reproducing and help your identical twin reproduce
