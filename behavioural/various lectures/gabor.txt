addictions:
 - not the problem
 - they are our attempt to solve the problem
 - important to question what the problem were trying to solve is
	- what happened in our lives that incured this pain

 - legal definition of addiction is that it's a choice that is punishable
	- medical definition is that it is a brain disease
	- in real life, it is an attempt to solve a problem
 
 - you don't punish people if they're suffering and trying to deal with their pain
	- you help them 
	- you cannot punish pain out of people

 - eg. stressed parents effect on child
	- can't fight, flight, or ask for help, so you tune out
	- this becomes a response later in life
	- abuse isn't necessary for addictions to happen, there was no abuse in this case

substance use addiction:
 - drug/alcohol addictions for example
 - oftentimes, quitting cold turkey is the only solution for these problems
 - lots of our behavioural addiction remedies are based off of substance use addictions

behavioural addictions:
 - include things like video game addiction and social media addiction
 - these are new addictions that are being treated as substances due to lack of research
 - not saying that substance use addiction solutions can't help, but this is a new disease

 - behavioural addictions are fundamentally different, they do something for us:
	- provide us with a sense of accomplishment, growth, relationships
	- that is why we play them, and taking it away like that is like taking away all your friends
	- eg. kid who played fortnite, parents didn't realize that all of his friends are online
		- taking it away will make it worse (alone/suicidal)
 - need to replace with other activities that fulfill that need
 
 - to play video games without being addicted:
	- you have to get the stuff the game gives you from other sources
	- if it is your only source of achievement in life, you will be addicted
	- as such, don't need to quit gaming to break addiction

 - if the only place you get confidence is from your challenger rank in league, you won't want to leave
	- especially if you have no confidence in real life
	- can't just take it away, will just be left with no confidence

trauma:
 - every case of addiction originates from trauma
 - eg. aboriginal example
 - addiction isn't the problem we face, it is us trying to solve the problem
 - gabor mate addiction to work example:
	- if you grow up feeling unwanted, you will try to cope with it however you can
	- for example, addicted to work being a doctor, because you are wanted all the time

 - trauma is passed on, unwillingly, unnoticed, through every day behaviours

dissociation:
 - when you are threatened, you typically can either fight, escape, or ask for help
 - if none of those options are available to you, your brain tries to protect you and dissociate you from the experience
 - eg. parents divorcing arguing
	- you can't fight back, escape, and too scared to ask for help
	- so what do you do, you tune out, dissociate yourself from it

treatment:
 - what did you get out of it, what was missing from your life that it gave you 
 - whatever was missing, how did you lose it

brain development:
 - unlike other species (horses), humans are born underdeveloped
 	- compare to horses who are able to run the day they are born	
 - as such, 90% of brain development happens after birth in the early years of life
 - this is when a large effect on genes and behaviour can take place

respectable addictions:
 - some addictions like addiction to work are more respected (praised even) than others like heroin
 - one is rewarded, and the other is ostracized

trauma:
 - addictions and disorders are our coping mechanisms for problems when we are young
 - only when we get older do they begin having adverse effects on our life
 - eg. if your parents are divorced, your risk of a stroke 60 years later is doubled
	- boys who were sexually abused have triple the rate of heart attacks when adults
	- girls whose fathers are distant menstruate earlier than those whose fathers are close to them
 - the point being shown is that these appearingly insignifcant environments have signficant impact in our life

genetic vs behavioural:
 - when a disease goes from 50% men and 50% women to 80% women and 20% in 70 years, this is not genetic
 - genes cannot change this much in less than one century, something else is going on here
 - many diseases are treated with stress hormone simulators, like steroids and dilators
	- they are like simulations of cortisol and adrenaline
	- strange how nobody is asking if stress has something to do with it then

cancer:
 - reflects on a lifetime relationship with the environment
 - smoking doesn't cause cancer
	- if smoking causes cancer, then everyone who has smoked would have cancer
	- it obviously contributes to cancer, but it's not by itself the cause

suppression of emotion:
 - no 2 year old baby suppresses their emotions
 - this is an adaptive response to the environment
	- it is used for surviving, but it becomes a pathology later on in life
 - depression is another adaptation
	- depression literally means to push down, in this case push down our emotions
	- why do we push them down? because parents can't handle them, so we hide them
	- it is an adaptation to our environment, we sense they are too stressed

elderly couple:
 - when one of them is hospitalized, the other is drastically more likely to die
 - their physiology is significantly influenced by their emotional life
 - pets are another example
	- dogs and cats are not treatments/medicine, but they can still help immensely

tuning out:
 - adhd add are halmarks of tuning out
 - tuning out isn't a symptom, it is a coping mechanism to stress
	- like a soldier continuing to run even with shot leg
	- when they get help, then they collapse

thanking the addictions:
 - before overcoming them, understand that they were there to solve the problem
 - only after that, can we reconcile
 - the task which hinders your task is the task

addiction is not a lack of will nor is it a brain disease
 - it is a response to human suffering, an attempt to temporarily escape suffering

rat park example:
 - give rats choice of water and cocaine water, they will pick the cocaine water and overdose
	- however this experiment was done with an isolated rat
 - if we test in rat park (lots of rats, toys, everything they need), the cocaine water is never used
 - drugs don't cause drug addiction
	- pain causes addiction, addiction is what we do to solve it
	- if we are traumatized, lonely, or depressed, we will resort to something that comforts us
		- video games, substances, porn, gambling

what we crave:
 - purpose
 - affection
 - sense of direction
