no "x" should feel this:
 - this is a statement that indicates a lie

chained elephant:
 - when nervous, you lean away, rock side to side, like an escapee
 - when innocent, you lean more forward, trying to provide as much information as possible

adaptors:
 - things people use to get rid of built up stress or tension
 - repetitive behaviours like rocking, touching their face, whatever
 - it means whatever your talking about at that point, it's making them uncomfortable

behaviour vs language:
 - humans have been dealing with behaviour and emotion much longer than language
 - before language, we could tell emotions and behaviour without expressing them
 - eg. grief vs begging for forgiveness
