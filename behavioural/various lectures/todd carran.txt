addiction pt 1

addiction is a disease:
 - there is no choice, and it doesn't involve morals or ethics or strength
 - it's why we can't just tell addict to simply stop
 - addict does not have choice once addicted (definition of addiction)

what are the criteria for a disease:
 - 1) has to be detrimental (damage the individual)
	- some infections are not diseases as they are completely harmless
 - 2) know the signs and symptoms of the disease
	- what it looks like when they have it (fatigue, etc)
 - 3) there must be an abnormal test for people with the disease
	- eg. elevated blood sugar in those with diabetes

addiction is a disease of the brain:
 - our abnormal test for addiction is a brain scan

nucleus acumbens:
 - pleasure center at the base of the brain
 - it will get you to repeat behaviours that stimulate neurons here
 - addictive substances stimulate the acumbens far more than any of the natural stimulants (food, water, etc)

frontal lobe:
 - used to determine good/bad, safe/unsafe of choices
 - activity here in those with addiction is reduced, and increased in the nucleus acumbens

difficulty of changing human behaviours:
 - it's why addiction is so hard to fix, changing human behaviours is extremely tough
 - common example is obesity, as it is essentially calories in vs calories out
	- should be simple (eat less, exercise more), yet our ability cure obesity is awful
	- gastric bypass surgery (literally shrinking stomach so can't eat) is easier than changing behaviours
