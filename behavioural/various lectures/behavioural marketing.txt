scarcity value:
 - "itll prob get busy later on"
 - "only 4 seats left"

why we go to the doctor:
 - not to get well, but to be reassured

diversity recruitment:
 - imbalances not due to prejudice, but to status quo bias
 - means that: if you're making ONE decision, you'll go very close to the expected norm
 - if you had 1 car, you would prob get a middle size fit all saloon car that is generic
 	- once 2 cars becomes the norm, households typically have two different cars, and neither of them saloon cars
 - same applies to diversity hiring
	- hiring people in groups actually solves this, and people will automatically make diverse hiring decisions
		- they are looking for complimentary skills among a group

marketing and military:
 - fields like these benefit creative solutions rather than the business approach of cutting costs and increasing price
 - oftentimes in military and marketing, the most efficient solution meets the most resistance
	- either because everyone is doing it or you being expected is costly
 - the problem is it's safer to the employees, as they can't get fired for a logical decision
	- eg. decrease price, increase flavour (obviously..)
 - human behaviour isn't objective, proportionate, nor maximizing

optimization:
 - for some reason, human behaviour models assume that we are trying to maximize/optimize something
 - in a game like archery, this makes sense
	- there is a target you want to aim for, and that is the optimal strategy to winning that game
	- likely why archery isn't televised or viewed that much
		- there are no tradeooffs (eg. always aiming for 10, there's nothing else)
	- darts on the other hand has more variation involved and strategy
		 - eg. if bad at darts, aim for southwest area of board (less variation in numbers)
 - human evolution is more like darts than archery
	- do i climb up an extra 10 feet to get more cherries of the tree, even if there's a risk of death

 - the reason why mcdonalds is successful
	- not because it's really good, but because it's really good at not being bad
	- humans don't like variance, if 1/10 times the outcome is fatal but 9/10 it's amazing, we won't risk it

fear of the negative:
 - shooting a penalty down the middle has a statistically higher chance of scoring than aiming left or right
	- the problem is if you shoot it down the middle and they save it, you look stupid
	- if you shoot it left/right and they save it, then w/e unlucky
 - this fear drives many business decisions
	- fear of the negative of stronger than the desire for the positive

adaptors:
 - things people use to get rid of built up stress or tension
 - repetitive behaviours like rocking, touching their face, whatever
 - it means whatever your talking about at that point, it's making them uncomfortable

behaviour vs language:
 - humans have been dealing with behaviour and emotion much longer than language
 - before language, we could tell emotions and behaviour without expressing them
 - eg. grief vs begging for forgiveness
