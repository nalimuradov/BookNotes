thinking fast:
 - system 1
 - automated responses that aren't conscious
 - 2+2=4, no thinking required
 - if i say vomit, it triggers some unpleasentness, no conscious effort required
 - it does not mean system 1 is bad, in fact when we become very talented at something, we autopilot

thinking slow:
 - system 2
 - thinking that requires effort
 - 17*24, we know it requires multiplying the two values but we must think to get answer

limit to effort:
 - there is only so much effort a person can give at a given time
 - eg. telling a person to remember 7 digits in their hand
	- then, offer them a dessert choice: chocolate cake or fruit salad
	- those who are busy remembering digits are more likely to choose the cake
	- self control demands some effort too, and that effort may be being used up by the memorization

progress effect:
 - if you press a link and it endlessly loads, you'll leave
 - if you're provided with a progressing loading bar, you'll wait it out

convincing others:
 - rather than trying to change the behaviour of others, try to change the environment
 - try to make it easy for them to change on their own

constructing narrative on first impression:
 - hotel company found that the tips they received directly correlated with initial checkin experience
	- if checkin was good, guests immediately constructed a narrative that it's a good place and found supporting evidence for that
		- eg. appreciate ice sculpture, amenities
	- however if checkin was bad, guests immediately had a bad narrative and found evidence to support that
		- eg. ice sculpture was bad, etc.
 - logically, one would think that the tip would be fair based on the service, but it isn't
 - their overall impression of the hotel was entirely dictated and based off of their initial checkin

certainty:
 - scenario 1: 49% chance to win $500,000 or 50% chance to win $470,000
	- nearly everyone will take first option, no one wants to take $30,000 loss for 1% extra chance
 - scenario 2: 99% chance to win $500,000 or 100% chance to win $470,000
 	- nearly everyone will take the guaranteed $470,000
	- people pay a premium for certainty
 - in a logical sense, you should behave the same way to both scenarios, but no one does
