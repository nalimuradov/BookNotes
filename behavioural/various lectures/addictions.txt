addictions:
 - not the problem
 - they are our attempt to solve the problem
 - important to question what the problem were trying to solve is
	- what happened in our lives that incured this pain

 - legal definition of addiction is that it's a choice that is punishable
	- medical definition is that it is a brain disease
	- in real life, it is an attempt to solve a problem
 
 - you don't punish people if they're suffering and trying to deal with their pain
	- you help them 
	- you cannot punish pain out of people

 - eg. stressed parents effect on child
	- can't fight, flight, or ask for help, so you tune out
	- this becomes a response later in life
	- abuse isn't necessary for addictions to happen, there was no abuse in this case

substance use addiction:
 - drug/alcohol addictions for example
 - oftentimes, quitting cold turkey is the only solution for these problems
 - lots of our behavioural addiction remedies are based off of substance use addictions

behavioural addictions:
 - include things like video game addiction and social media addiction
 - these are new addictions that are being treated as substances due to lack of research
 - not saying that substance use addiction solutions can't help, but this is a new disease

 - behavioural addictions are fundamentally different, they do something for us:
	- provide us with a sense of accomplishment, growth, relationships
	- that is why we play them, and taking it away like that is like taking away all your friends
	- eg. kid who played fortnite, parents didn't realize that all of his friends are online
		- taking it away will make it worse (alone/suicidal)
 - need to replace with other activities that fulfill that need
 
 - to play video games without being addicted:
	- you have to get the stuff the game gives you from other sources
	- if it is your only source of achievement in life, you will be addicted
	- as such, don't need to quit gaming to break addiction

 - if the only place you get confidence is from your challenger rank in league, you won't want to leave
	- especially if you have no confidence in real life
	- can't just take it away, will just be left with no confidence

trauma:
 - every case of addiction originates from trauma
 - eg. aboriginal example
 - addiction isn't the problem we face, it is us trying to solve the problem
 - gabor mate addiction to work example:
	- if you grow up feeling unwanted, you will try to cope with it however you can
	- for example, addicted to work being a doctor, because you are wanted all the time

 - trauma is passed on, unwillingly, unnoticed, through every day behaviours

dissociation:
 - when you are threatened, you typically can either fight, escape, or ask for help
 - if none of those options are available to you, your brain tries to protect you and dissociate you from the experience
 - eg. parents divorcing arguing
	- you can't fight back, escape, and too scared to ask for help
	- so what do you do, you tune out, dissociate yourself from it

treatment:
 - what did you get out of it, what was missing from your life that it gave you 
 - whatever was missing, how did you lose it

brain development:
 - unlike other species (horses), humans are born underdeveloped
 	- compare to horses who are able to run the day they are born	
 - as such, 90% of brain development happens after birth in the early years of life
 - this is when a large effect on genes and behaviour can take place

respectable addictions:
 - some addictions like addiction to work are more respected (praised even) than others like heroin
 - one is rewarded, and the other is ostracized

trauma:
 - addictions and disorders are our coping mechanisms for problems when we are young
 - only when we get older do they begin having adverse effects on our life
 - eg. if your parents are divorced, your risk of a stroke 60 years later is doubled
	- boys who were sexually abused have triple the rate of heart attacks when adults
	- girls whose fathers are distant menstruate earlier than those whose fathers are close to them
 - the point being shown is that these appearingly insignifcant environments have signficant impact in our life

genetic vs behavioural:
 - when a disease goes from 50% men and 50% women to 80% women and 20% in 70 years, this is not genetic
 - genes cannot change this much in less than one century, something else is going on here
 - many diseases are treated with stress hormone simulators, like steroids and dilators
	- they are like simulations of cortisol and adrenaline
	- strange how nobody is asking if stress has something to do with it then

cancer:
 - reflects on a lifetime relationship with the environment
 - smoking doesn't cause cancer
	- if smoking causes cancer, then everyone who has smoked would have cancer
	- it obviously contributes to cancer, but it's not by itself the cause

suppression of emotion:
 - no 2 year old baby suppresses their emotions
 - this is an adaptive response to the environment
	- it is used for surviving, but it becomes a pathology later on in life
 - depression is another adaptation
	- depression literally means to push down, in this case push down our emotions
	- why do we push them down? because parents can't handle them, so we hide them
	- it is an adaptation to our environment, we sense they are too stressed

elderly couple:
 - when one of them is hospitalized, the other is drastically more likely to die
 - their physiology is significantly influenced by their emotional life
 - pets are another example
	- dogs and cats are not treatments/medicine, but they can still help immensely

tuning out:
 - adhd add are halmarks of tuning out
 - tuning out isn't a symptom, it is a coping mechanism to stress
	- like a soldier continuing to run even with shot leg
	- when they get help, then they collapse

thanking the addictions:
 - before overcoming them, understand that they were there to solve the problem
 - only after that, can we reconcile
 - the task which hinders your task is the task

addiction is not a lack of will nor is it a brain disease
 - it is a response to human suffering, an attempt to temporarily escape suffering

rat park example:
 - give rats choice of water and cocaine water, they will pick the cocaine water and overdose
	- however this experiment was done with an isolated rat
 - if we test in rat park (lots of rats, toys, everything they need), the cocaine water is never used
 - drugs don't cause drug addiction
	- pain causes addiction, addiction is what we do to solve it
	- if we are traumatized, lonely, or depressed, we will resort to something that comforts us
		- video games, substances, porn, gambling

what we crave:
 - purpose
 - affection
 - sense of direction

dr k example:
 - patient with autistic son who is addicted to video games
 - parents suggest taking away video games, but they don't realize his only friends are on the internet
	- if you take them away, he'll just become depressed and suicidal
 - need to understand what you are getting out of the addiction
 - if you want to be free from video games, be able to play them without becoming addicted:
	- you have to get the stuff the video games gives you in other parts of life

 - if the only place you get confidence is from your diamond rank in league, you won't want to quit
	- you need to get confidence from other facets in your life
	- you can't just take it away, you'll just be left with no confidence

addiction is a bandaid:
 - quit video games will just lead to browsing the internet and watching netflix, need to get to the root of the problem
 - eg. girl who self harms, drinks, and has eating disorder
	- turns out that removing one of those makes the other two much worse
	- eg. removing the self harm will make the drinking and eating disorder worse
 - they are coping mechanisms to deal with negative emotions

gaming and cocaine dopamine:
 - cocaine spikes dopamine initially and it tapers off
 - gaming provides a constant stream of dopamine with periodic spurts
	- that's why you can play for 12+ hours

dopamine exhaustion:
 - due to this constant stream of dopamine, many subjects will find other activities boring
 - eg. gardening, reading, working, exercising are all "boring"
	- in reality, the video games have raised your dopamine tolerance so high that other activities simply cannot compete

-----------------------

similaritites to online gaming:
 - endless novelty
 - easily accessible

neurobiological impact:
 - dopamine is our main motivation neurotransmitter
 - endogenous opioids are our main reward chemicals
 - when down, dopamine will entice us to seek for previous things we've done to lift us up:
	- in many cases, it may be an addiction
 - naltrexone is a common solution to overdosing, but also helps with minimizing the dopamine rush
	- the lesser amount of dopamine may dissuade future use

coolidge effect:
 - we have a powerful response to novelty
 - you get tired of the same partner, but a new partner will get you excited
 - your brain cannot differentiate between a real partner and a 2d screen
 - sexual stimulation gives the largest dopamine hit out of anything natural
	- eg. excluding drugs like cocaine, which provide a massive dopamine hit

variable ratio schedule of reward:
 - this is another critical point about prn and addictions in general, keeps people clicking and engaged
 - eg. if you are searching through pornographic videos and find one you like after 5 videos, then another after 6, and another after 1
	- this irregular schedule causes a steady state of responding in your brain, keeping you constantly fixed and focused
	- you never know when the next good one is gonna come

why use it:
 - learning/curiosity
 - belonging to a group
 - pleasure/permission
 - coping with distress

addiction:
 - chronic, progressive behavioural disorder where person does compulsive behaviour despite adverse consequences
 - involves the brain reward systems
 - it's important to not that it's the behaviour around the substance, not the use of it

features of addiction:
 - impaired control (cravings)
 - social impairment (failure to fulfill obligations)
 - risky use of substance (failure to abstain despite problem)
 - pharmocological (tolerance and withdrawal)

video game addiction:
 - cannot quit the game if my primary community is the game
 - cannot quit the game if my only source of confidence in accomplishment is my rank
