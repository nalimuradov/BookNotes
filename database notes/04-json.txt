JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
 - used for data interchange
 - useful for represeting and storing data
 - no longer tied to JavaScript

Base Values
 - have numbers, strings, boolean, null

Objects and Arrays
 - objects specified with {}
 - arrays specified with []

Structure
 - based on sets and arrays
 - can be nested

Schema
 - self-describing 
 - the schema elements are within the data itself

Queries
 - nothing widely used for querying JSON data

Ordering
 - uses arrays which are ordered
 
Implementation
 - usually coupled with programming languages

JSON vs XML
 - XML is more verbose
 - XML is more complex
 

JSON Validator
 - can send JSON file into it to check for syntactic errors
 - can send JSON schema along with file to also find semantic errors
 - if it goes through, they can be parsed into objects in a programming language


JSON Objects
 - set of label-value pairs
 - {"Books": ... , "Magazines": ...} 
 - the label is Books and the value is the array of objects after, same for magazine

JSON Schema
 - written in JSON itself
 - ensures semantic correctness of the JSON file
 - can put a new label-value pair and it will be fine for JSON schema
 - can add "additionalProperties":false and it will prevent new pairs
 - any property not specified in the schema will not be allowed
