Databases are massive
 - handle terabytes of data

Databases are persistent
 - data will still exist after program is finished running
 - other machines have program that starts, uses data, then goes away when finished

They must be safe
 - hardware and software failures
 - power outage
 - hackers

Must allow multiple users to access the database
 - use concurrency control

Databases are convenient
 - the way data is stored on disk is independent of the data operations
 - physical data independence
 - also use high level query languages

They must be very efficient
 - must handle thousands of queries/updates per second
 
Must be reliable
 - 99.99% of the time
