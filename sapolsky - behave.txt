Robert Sapolsky - Behave


CHAPTER 1 - The Behaviour ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

violence:
 - not hated, rather we fear the wrong kind of violence
 - we watch mma, teach kids to fight back, etc

altruism:
 - pure altruistic people seem unnerving, draw suspicion
 - eg. donating a kidney
	- is she getting paid secretly?
	- is she starved for attention?

passion:
 - the opposite of love is not hate, but indifference
 - hate and love are similar in many ways (as we will see)


CHAPTER 2 - One Second Before ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

triune brain model:
 - layer 1:
	- ancient part, at the base of the brain
	- found across many species
	- hunger, pain, cold, stress, etc
 - layer 2:
	- more recently evolved, mammalian, on upper surface
	- see something gruesome, sends signals to layer 1
	- feeling unloved? will send signals to layer 1 to generate comfort food craving
 - layer 3:
	- neocortex, on upper surface of brain
	- cognition, memory storage, sensory processing, abstractions
	- read a scary book? layer 3 sends signal to layer 2 to make you scared, which sends to layer 1
	- see an oreo ad and feel a craving? will influence lower layers
 - truthfully they are intertwined, but this is a good metaphor for now

limbic system: 
 - layer 2 and its emphasis on emotion, termed 'limbic system'
 - olfactory bulbs:
	- one for each nostril
	- primary receptive area for odors
 - hypothalamus:
	- limbic structure
	- interface between layer 2 and 1
	- sends signals from 2 to 1
	- too hot? blood sent to body surface to dissipate heat
	- this is all automatic, or autonomic
	- 'autonomic nervous system'
	- this is how emotions change bodily functions

autonomic nervous system has two parts:
 - sympathetic nervous system (SNS):
	- mediates body's response to arousing circumstances
	- eg. fight or flight
 - parasympathetic nervous system (PNS):
	- about calm, vegetative states
	- slows down heart, promotes digestion
	- opposite of SNS

cortex:
 - brain's upper surface, the newest part
 - logical crown jewel of layer 3
 - sensory information flows there to be decoded
 - muscles are commanded to move here
 - where language is comprehended and produced
 - where meomories are stored
 - damage to cortex can inhibit things like speaking:
	- however, some people can sign what they want
	- an emotive, limbic detour

 - frontal cortex is the interface between layers 2 and 3

parts of the cortex:
 - folded into convolutions
 - convolutions form a superstructure of four lobes:
	- temporal
	- parietal
	- occipital
	- frontal
 - each have different functions
 - diagram on pg 33 (pdf)

symmetry:
 - brain structure contains bilateral sections
 - left and right amygdala, hippocampus, temporal lobe, etc

 - left hemisphere of cortex is analytical
 - right hemisphere more involved in intuition and creativity

amygdala:
 - greek word for 'almond'
 - under the cortex in temporal love
 - central to mediating aggression, and many other behaviours related to aggression
 - show images that provoke anger, and amygdala activates
 - having it removedor sedated (novacain) decreases rates of aggression

 - texas tower sniper shooting
 - killed mom, wife, and thirty two others
 - left note saying couldnt find reason to kill but did, he loved them, and wanted his brain autopsied
 - turns out he had tumor pressing on his amygdala
 - it's not the only reason (his childhood), but definitely had some effect

 - also related to fear and anxiety, not only aggression
 - in PTSD sufferers, amygdala is overreactive to mildly fearful stimuli and is slow in calming

 - gets sensory inputs from all sensory systems (eg. jaws track gets you scared)
 - also takes information about pain

 - bidirectional communication with frontal cortex, insula, PAG
 - interfaces with hippocampus

 - eg. in cage A a tone is followed by a shock, whereas in cage B it's just a tone
	- amygdala learns the stimilus cue (the tone)
	- hippocampus learns about the contexts of cage A versus B

 - we remember view of platting hitting world trade, but don't remember if there were clouds:
	- hippocampus decides whether a fact is worth saving or not

 - in many interactions, amygdala is faster but less accurate (as opposed to waiting for eg. cortex)
 - heart does roughlt same thing when in murderous rage or mid orgasm:
	- again, the opposite of love is not hate, but indifference

frontal cortex:
 - works with memory, gratification postponement, regulation of emotions
 - frontal cortex makes you do the harder thing when it's the right thing to do
 - last part of brain to mature (not fully online until people are in their midtwenties)

 - prefrontal cortex (PFC):
	- the decider, chooses between conflicting options (coke or pepsoi)
	- typically for preventing imprudent behaviours

 - also mediates 'executive function', looking for bits of information, patterns:
	- eg. someone says 'im buying peaches, detergent, cinnamon,....'
	- now asked to recite, and they only remember a few
	- if repeated, they remember more and start to notice patterns (eg. 4 foods, 4 cleaning items, ...)
	- prefrontal cortex imposes a strategy to remember everything

 - self control is a finite resource:
	- frontal neurons are expensive cells, therefore they are vulnerable cells
	- make it work hard, and next task performance declines (or multitasking)

 - self discipline:
	- you quickly learn not to pee everywhere when you're young, so much so that now it's ingrained
	- playing a hard part in a song, but eventually becoming so good that it's more reflexive (cerebellum) than PFC

 - we use the frontal cortex to do the harder thing in social situations:
	- don't belch loudly at dinner
	- don't make sexual advances despite fantasies
	- don't hit coworker

 - phineas gage:
	- had pipe blown through his head, taking out his frontal cortex
	- survived, but was indulging, irreverent, fitful
	- inappropriate behaviour
	- after few years, got better - his right frontal cortical tissue took on some of the functions after injury

 - trolley problem:
 	- tell people pull level to save 5 but 1 will be killed, 70-90% say yes
	- tell people same problem but instead you push the 1 guy to save 5, 70-90% say no
	- intentionally killing someone with your own hands activates the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) along with vmPFC and amygdala
	- in the lever scenario, only the dlPFC activates (a purely cerebral decision, like choosing which tool to use)

mesolimbic/mesocortical dopamine system:
 - reward, pleasure, happiness:
	- drugs like heroin release dopamine in accumbens
	- even the thought of sex releases dopamine in humans
	- food evokes dopamine and satiation

 - nuclei, inputs, and outputs:
	- dopamine is synthesized in multiple brain regions
	- tegmentum and accumbens are the primary sources of projections
		- connect with PFC, amygdala, hippocampus, etc

 - releases occur in social interactions too:
	- one study had a player either split reward or backstab and get whole reward
	- greater dopamine reward in sharing
	- punishment also releases dopamine

 - jealousy:
	- show person pictures of attractive/successful person to make person jealous
	- activated pain perception cortical regions
	- then tell them they suffered a tragedy (eg. demoted), and dopamine will be released

 - nothing is ever good enough:
 	- monkey pulling lever 10 times to get a raisin: fat dopamine boost
	- monkey pulls lever 10 times and get two raisins: even bigger boost
	- now monkey pulls lever 10 times and gets one raising: declining dopamine!
	- we are accustomed to want more
	- biologically this makes sense:
		- need to weigh reward relative to alternative outcomes
	- what was an unexpected pleasure yesterday is what we feel entitled to today
		- hunters back in the day probably got fat dopamine rush from stumbling upon honey
		- now we're bombarded with sweets all day

 - purchase price study:
	- show subject a shopping item and ask them how much they would spend
	- if actual price was less, emotional vmPFC activated
	- if actual price was more, disgust-related insular cortex would activate
	- could use neuroimaging data and predict who would buy it or not

 - anticipation of reward:
	- light turns on for monkey study to pull 10 levers
	- small dopamine boost when he gets the raising
	- however, there is also a dopamine boost  when the light turns on HOOOLY
 	- dopamine is less about its reward and more about the anticipation

 	- if you know your appetite will be sated, pleasure is more about the appetite than the sating

	- take alcoholic who recovered to where the consumption used to occur
	- synapses, cues that were learned associations to alcohol, come roaring back into action
	- dopamine surges, craving inundates

	- now make scenario where press lever: 50% chance of reward
	- even more dopamine
	- nothing fuels dopamine like the "maybe"

	- in gambling, a "near miss" activated the dopamine system like crazy
	- eg. when get two in a row and waiting for third to line up
	
	- well perceived risk is addictive
	- ambiguity is just agitating

	- time delay:
		- if waiting 2X amount of time for reward, reward is 4X smaller (1/4)
		- value of 1/4 is coded in the accumbens
		- dlPFC and vmPFC neurons code for time delay
		- now if we activate vmPFC or inactivate dlPFC, short term reward becomes more alluring
		- in short tempered people, accumbens underestimates magnitude of delayed reward

 - humans and reward delay:
	- no animal delays rewards as long as humans
	- no warthog is cutting calories to look good for summer
	- no gerbil is getting good marks for a good job 10 years down the line

serotonin:
 - predicted impulsive aggression (rather than premeditated)

three central chapter points:
 - the hub of aggression (amygdala)
 - the hub of reward (dopaminergic system)
 - the hub of restraint (prefrontal cortex)


CHAPTER 3 - Seconds to Minutes Before ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

triggers of behaviour:
 - auditory: roar, howl, sing
 - visual: monkeys show canines, dogs crouch to play
 - undetectable triggers: eel electric songs, bats compete for echolocation

 - it's easy to see how seeing a knife or hearing your name can rapidly alter your brain
 - however, many subliminal sensory triggers also do this, but we don't consciously note them
	- people think potato chips taste better when hearing the crunching sound

 - race:
	- flashing an image of a person for even one hundredth of a second, our brain will know
	- can activate amygdala depending on how racist person is
	- many racist thoughs are subconscious in us, before our PFC can suppress and rationalize

	- person has 1/5th of a second to decide if image is of threatening person or not
	- simply being black evoked a stronger P200 waveform than being white, regardless if they had weapon

 	- black criminals face longer sentence the more stereotypical they look
	- that's why some lawyers give black people blocky glasses, 'nerdy look' for shorter sentence

 - halo effect:
	- very real, the more attractive, the smarter, kinder, etc you appear to others, regardless if true

 - sweat:
	- scientists smelled two kinds of sweat
	- one from regular exercise
	- one from fear of skydiving jump
	- the fear one activated the amygdala 
	- if people around you are scared, you should be too

 - nonpheromonal smells:
	- also has impact
	- if people sit in room with garbage, they will have more conservative views about social issues such as gay marriage

 - hunger:
	- when people are hungry, they are less charitable and more willing to punish

 - prisoners dilemma:
	- call it 'wall street game' and people become less cooperative
	- call it 'community game' and people become more cooperative
	- reading fuzzy prosocial ("help", "fair") words before playing makes people cooperate
	- reading "fierce", "rank", "power" does the opposite

 - hypothetical drug:
	- "drug has 95% success rate", people more likely to approve it
	- "drug has 5% death rate", people less likely to approve

 - even subtler cues:
	- person 'falls' and hurts ankle at soccer game
	- much more likely to get help if wearing home team jersey rather than neutral or away team

 - conflicting stereotypes:
	- study of asian american women writing a math test
	- assumptions that women do worse than men in math, but asians do better than americans in math
	- racial vs gender identity

bystander effect:
 - kitty genovese tragedy
 - "there's lots of people here, someone else will step forward"
 - however, in dangerous situations, the more people present, the more likely someone steps forward
	- bigger crowd equals more witnesses to the heroics

social environment:
 - crimes more likely when there are broken windows, graffiti, trash everywhere
 - more likely to steal five-euro bill if litter nearby
 - new york crime drop with zero tolerance for litter and graffity


CHAPTER FOUR - Hours to Days Before ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

testosterone:
 - hormone
 - correlation vs causation
 - testosterone often linked with aggression, however must test for causation rather than correlation
 - to test, castrate a male
	- aggression decreases? yes, then there is causation
	- give testosterone back and aggression increase? yes
	- thus, testosterone causes aggression, right?
	- however, castrated male can still be aggressive

 - in study, higher testosterone level seen in male prisoners with higher rates of aggression
	- but being aggressive STIMUATES testosterone secretion
	- so no wonder more aggressive individuals had higher levels
	- chicken and egg problem

 - have to ask: whether differences in test levels among individuals can predict who will be aggressive
	- answer is no (among mammals, fish, birds, and humans)

 - testosterone typically increases confidence and optimism:
	- also decreases fear and anxiety
	- makes subjects think their own opinion was correct and ignore input from others
	- makes people cocky, egocentric, narcissistic

 - boosts impulsivity and risk taking:
	- decreases activity in PFC and its functional coupling to the amygdala
	- increases amygdaloid coupling with the thalamus (source of shortcut path of sensory info to amygdala)
	- thus, more influence by that split-second, low-accuracy input
	- instead of the stop-and-think-about-this from the PFC
 
 - testosterone's effects are hugely context dependent:
	- rather than causing X, test amplifies the power of something else to cause X
	- eg. increases amygdala response rate to angry faces

 - talapoin monkey experiment:
	- middle ranking monkey (rank #3 out of 5 monkeys) was administered testosterone, increasing aggression levels
	- did he challenge #1 and #2 for higher spot? no
	- rather he became a more aggressive jerk to #4 and #5
	- exaggerated pre-existing social patterns rather than create new ones

 - challenge hypothesis:
	- when testosterone rises after a challenge, it doesn't prompt aggression
	- instead it prompts whatever behaviours are needed to maintain status (which in the case of monkeys is aggression)
	- but what if your status requires you to be nice?
		- eg. split money or take all, if both take then no money is made game (prisoners dilemma)
		- testosterone actually made them make more generous offers

oxytocin:
 - hormone
 - functions related to child birth and maternal behaviour
 - along with vasopressing (together called the neuropeptides), facilitates bonding between parent/child and couples
 - in the 0.1% of time oxytocin has existend (last 50000 years), when a dog and its owner interact, they secrete oxytocin
 
 - makes patients less aggressive, and they rate faces as more trustworth

 - cultural contingencies of oxytocin:
	- group of americans and koreans
	- during unstressful situations, nothing happened
	- during stress, oxytocing made people more likely to ask for help, but only the americans

 - contingency similar to testosterone:
	- oxytocin enhances charitability, but only in people already doing so

 - dark side of oxytocin:
	- it enhances trust and cooperation in a game, but not if player is anonymous or in another room
	- it will decreases cooperation, increase envy, and enhance gloating when winning
	
	- makes you more prosocial to people like you (eg. teammates), but lousy to others who are a threat (enemies)
	- ethnocentrism and xenophobia ("us")
	- as everything, always depends on the context

estrogen:
 - female aggression
 - two receptors for estrogen in the brain (aggression, but also empathy/emotional recognition)
 - female hyenas typically boot off males who hunted the food, so kids can eat

stress:
 - a stressor is anything that disrupts homeostasis (ideal body temp, heart rate, glucose level, etc.)
 	- eg. being chased by a lion, or chasing a zebra
 - during stress: growth, tissue repair, reproduction are postponed until after crisis:
	- none of those would matter if you died from whatever is chasing you

 - during stress, amygdala becomes highly sensitive to glucocorticoids
	- amplifies pre-existing excitation
	- makes it easier to learn a fear-association and consolidate into a long-term memory
	- also makes it harder to unlearn fear
	- eg. it is the BLA (basolateral amygdala) that learns fear extinction
		- the light turning on isn't going to shock me now (as it used to)
	- stress facilitates learning fear associations but impairs learning fear extinction

 - sustained stress impairs risk assessment 
	- gambles become more risk-taking (if they originally were) or more risk-averse (if they originally were)

 - spousal/partner violence goes up 10% when local football team unexpectedly loses
	- no increase if they won or were expected to lose
	- 13% increase when team was in playoff contention
	- 20% increase when upset by a rival
 
 - stress biases us towards selfishness
	- the more glucocorticoid levels rose, the more egoistic the answers

conclusion:
 - hormones don't determine, command, cause, or invent behaviours
 - instead they make us more sensitive to the social triggers of emotionally laden behaviours and exaggerate pre-existing tendencies
 - where do these pre-existing tendencies come from? next chapter

CHAPTER FIVE - Days to Months Before ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nonlinear excitation:
 - how do synapses remember? how can events from months ago produce a synapse with altered excitability today?
 - a new memory requires the strengthening of pre-exisiting synapses
	- research by Donald Hebb

neuron strengthening:
 - if neuron A synapses onto neuron B, it means that an action potential in neuron A more readily triggers one in neuron B
 - they become more tightly coupled, they "remember"
 - repeated firing across the synapse "strengthens" it (which is experience)
 - key role played by the neurotransmitter glutamate
 
glutamate signaling:
 - dendritic spines contain two receptors
 - first one (non-NDMA) works in a conventional way
	- for every smidgen of of glutamate binding to receptors, a smidgen of sodium flows in, causing a smidgen of excitation
 - second one (NDMA) works in a threshold manner
	- usually unresponsive to glutamate
	- it is not until the non-NDMA has been stimulated over and over by a long train of glutamate release that this activates NDMA receptor
	- suddenly it responds to all glutamate, opening its channels, allowing an explosion of excitation
	- this is the essence of learning
		- teacher says something, goes in one ear, out the other
		- they say it over and over and eventually it sticks

'aha' versus actually remembering:
 - LTP -> long term potentiation
	- the process by which the first burst of NDMA receptor activation causes a prolonged increase in excitability of the synapse
 - when NDMA receptors finally activate, it is calcium (rather than sodium) that flows in
 - this causes an array of changes:
	- calcium tidal wave causes more copies of glutamate receptors to be inserted into dendritic spine's membrane
		- this makes neuron more responsive to glutamate thereafter
	- calcium alters glutamate receptors that are already on the front lines of that dendritic spine
		- each will now be more sensitive to glutamate signals
	- calcium also causes synthesis of peculiar neurotransmitters in dendritic spine, which are release and travel backward across the synapse
		- there they increase the amount of glutamate released from the axon terminal after future action potentials

 - LTP and LTD are what happens in hippocampus when we learn facts:
	- eg. a phone number
	- what about how we learn to be afraid? to feel empathy? control impulses?

axonal plasticity:
 - after five days of being blindfolded, subjects start to remap auditory projections into the visual cortex
	- retract once the blindfolds come off
 - adaptation

neuroplasticity:
 - neurogenesis is real, adult brains can in fact create neurons
 - cab drivers have larger hippocampus (spacial maps)
 - definitely finite, as grievous brain damage does not ultimately heal
 - skilled individuals have put tens of thousands of hours into to be great
	- however, the reverse doesn't hold
	- tens of thousands of hours doesn't guarantee you will be lebron

CHAPTER SIX - Adolescence; or, Dude, Where's My Frontal Cortex? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

adolescence and early adulthood:
 - this is the time when people are most likely to:
	- invent an art form
	- leave home forever
	- kill or be killed
	- help overthrow a dictator
	- ethnically cleanse a village
	- become addicted
 - time of maximal risk taking, novelty seeking, affiliation with peers
	- all because of immature frontal cortex

pg. 152 - adolescent risk taking
