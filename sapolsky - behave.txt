Robert Sapolsky - Behave

violence:
 - not hated, rather we fear the wrong kind of violence
 - we watch mma, teach kids to fight back, etc

altruism:
 - pure altruism seem unnerving, draw suspicion
 - eg. donating kidney
	- is she getting paid secretly?
	- is she starved for attention?

passion:
 - the opposite of love is not hate, but indifference
 - hate and love are similar in many ways (as we will see)

triune brain model:
 - layer 1:
	- ancient part, at the base of the brain
	- found across many species
	- hunger, pain, cold, stress, etc
 - layer 2:
	- more recently evolved, mammalian, on upper surface
	- see something gruesome, sends signals to layer 1
	- feeling unloved? will send signals to layer 1 to generate comfort food craving
 - layer 3:
	- neocortex, on upper surface of brain
	- cognition, memory storage, sensory processing, abstractions
	- read a scary book? layer 3 sends signal to layer 2 to make you scared, which sends to layer 1
	- see an oreo ad and feel a craving? will influence lower layers
 - truthfully they are intertwined, but this is a good metaphor for now

limbic system: 
 - layer 2 and its emphasis on emotion, termed 'limbic system'
 - olfactory bulbs:
	- one for each nostril
	- primary receptive area for odors
 - hypothalamus:
	- limbic structure
	- interface between layer 2 and 1
	- sends signals from 2 to 1
	- too hot? blood sent to body surface to dissipate heat
	- this is all automatic, or autonomic
	- 'autonomic nervous system'
	- this is how emotions change bodily functions

autonomic nervous system has two parts:
 - sympathetic nervous system (SNS):
	- mediates body's response to arousing circumstances
	- eg. fight or flight
 - parasympathetic nervous system (PNS):
	- about calm, vegetative states
	- slows down heart, promotes digestion
	- opposite of SNS

cortex:
 - brain's upper surface, the newest part
 - logical crown jewel of layer 3
 - sensory information flows there to be decoded
 - muscles are commanded to move here
 - where language is comprehended and produced
 - where meomories are stored
 - damage to cortex can inhibit things like speaking:
	- however, some people can sign what they want
	- an emotive, limbic detour

 - frontal cortex is the interface between layers 2 and 3

parts of the cortex:
 - folded into convolutions
 - convolutions form a superstructure of four lobes:
	- temporal
	- parietal
	- occipital
	- frontal
 - each have different functions
 - diagram on pg 33 (pdf)

symmetry:
 - brain structure contains bilateral sections
 - left and right amygdala, hippocampus, temporal lobe, etc

 - left hemisphere of cortex is analytical
 - right hemisphere more involved in intuition and creativity

amygdala:
 - greek word for 'almond'
 - under the cortex in temporal love
 - central to mediating aggression, and many other behaviours related to aggression
 - show images that provoke anger, and amygdala activates
 - having it removedor sedated (novacain) decreases rates of aggression

 - texas tower sniper shooting
 - killed mom, wife, and thirty two others
 - left note saying couldnt find reason to kill but did, he loved them, and wanted his brain autopsied
 - turns out he had tumor pressing on his amygdala
 - it's not the only reason (his childhood), but definitely had some effect

 - also related to fear and anxiety, not only aggression
 - in PTSD sufferers, amygdala is overreactive to mildly fearful stimuli and is slow in calming

 - gets sensory inputs from all sensory systems (eg. jaws track gets you scared)
 - also takes information about pain

 - bidirectional communication with frontal cortex, insula, PAG
 - interfaces with hippocampus

 - eg. in cage A a tone is followed by a shock, whereas in cage B it's just a tone
	- amygdala learns the stimilus cue (the tone)
	- hippocampus learns about the contexts of cage A versus B

 - we remember view of platting hitting world trade, but don't remember if there were clouds:
	- hippocampus decides whether a fact is worth saving or not

 - in many interactions, amygdala is faster but less accurate (as opposed to waiting for eg. cortex)
 - heart does roughlt same thing when in murderous rage or mid orgasm:
	- again, the opposite of love is not hate, but indifference

frontal cortex:
 - works with memory, gratification postponement, regulation of emotions
 - frontal cortex makes you do the harder thing when it's the right thing to do
 - last part of brain to mature (not fully online until people are in their midtwenties)

 - prefrontal cortex (PFC):
	- the decider, chooses between conflicting options (coke or pepsoi)

 - also mediates 'executive function', looking for bits of information, patterns:
	- eg. someone says 'im buying peaches, detergent, cinnamon,....'
	- now asked to recite, and they only remember a few
	- if repeated, they remember more and start to notice patterns (eg. 4 foods, 4 cleaning items, ...)
	- prefrontal cortex imposes a strategy to remember everything

 - self control is a finite resource:
	- frontal neurons are expensive cells, therefore they are vulnerable cells
	- make it work hard, and next task performance declines (or multitasking)

 - self discipline:
	- you quickly learn not to pee everywhere when you're young, so much so that now it's ingrained
	- playing a hard part in a song, but eventually becoming so good that it's more reflexive (cerebellum) than PFC
